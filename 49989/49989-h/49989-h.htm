<h1 title="">THE LOST MINE
<br />OF THE AMAZON</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">A RIDDLE</span></h2>
<p>Hal lay rigid in his deck chair and watched
from under half-closed lids. The dapper little
man came toward them soundlessly and approached
Denis Keen&rsquo;s chair with all the
slinking agility of a cat. Suddenly his hand
darted down toward the sleeping man&rsquo;s
pocket.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/img001.jpg" alt="SUDDENLY THE MAN&rsquo;S HAND DARTED DOWN TOWARD THE SLEEPING MAN&rsquo;S POCKET." width="500" height="745" />
<p class="pcap">SUDDENLY THE MAN&rsquo;S HAND DARTED DOWN TOWARD THE SLEEPING MAN&rsquo;S POCKET.</p>
</div>
<p>Hal leaped up in a flash, grasping the little
man&rsquo;s pudgy wrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea, huh? Whose pocket do
you think....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denis Keen awakened with a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hal&mdash;Se&ntilde;or Goncalves!&rdquo; he interposed.
&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the fuss, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fuss enough,&rdquo; said Hal angrily. &ldquo;The
fine Se&ntilde;or Goncalves has turned pickpocket I
guess. I saw him reaching down to your
pocket and....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are mistaken,&rdquo; protested the
dapper Brazilian. His voice, aggrieved and
sullen, suddenly resumed its usual purr.
&ldquo;See, gentlemen?&rdquo; he said with a note of
triumph.</p>
<p>Hal and his uncle followed the man&rsquo;s fluttering
hand and saw that he was pointing toward
a magazine thrust down between the
canvas covering and the woodwork of Denis
Keen&rsquo;s deck chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to get that&mdash;to have something to
read,&rdquo; purred the Se&ntilde;or. He turned to Hal
with that same triumphant manner. &ldquo;Being
short of chairs, I have shared this one with
your uncle. This afternoon I have sat in it
and read the magazine. I leave it there at
dinner and now I come to get it&mdash;so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is all true,&rdquo; said Denis Keen, getting
to his feet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly sorry that my
nephew put such a construction on your
actions, Se&ntilde;or Goncalves&mdash;terribly sorry. But
he didn&rsquo;t know about our sharing chairs and
that accounts for it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>Hal&rsquo;s smile was all contrition. He shrugged
his broad shoulders and gave the Brazilian a
firm, hearty handclasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My error, Goncalves. You see, I don&rsquo;t
know the arrangements on this scow yet. I&rsquo;ve
been knocking around below decks ever since
we left <i>Para</i>&mdash;talking to the crew and all that
sort of thing. It&rsquo;s my first experience in
Amazon, South America.&rdquo; He laughed. &ldquo;I
just came up a little while ago and after snooping
around found Unk asleep in that chair so
I just flopped into the vacant one next. Then
you came along&mdash;well, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Se&ntilde;or Goncalves moved off into the shadows
of the upper deck, smiling and content. The
small echo of his purring goodnight lingered
on the breeze, bespeaking the good will with
which he parted from his new-found American
friends.</p>
<p>Hal and his uncle had again settled themselves
in the deck chairs and for a long time
after the Brazilian had gone they sat in
silence. The boat ploughed on through the
softly swishing Amazon and there was no other
sound save the throbbing of the engines below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Hal, &lsquo;all&rsquo;s well that ends well,&rsquo; eh?&rdquo;
said Denis Keen, stifling a yawn. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty
glad that our dapper Se&ntilde;or took our apologies
and parted in a friendly spirit. It goes to
prove how necessary it is for you to curb that
reckless reasoning of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal shifted his lanky legs and ran his
fingers through a mass of curly red hair. His
freckled face was unusually grave as he turned
to his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, you didn&rsquo;t fall for that, did you?&rdquo;
he asked with not a little surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not&mdash;you were in the wrong! As I
said before&mdash;your recklessness, Hal....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unk, that wasn&rsquo;t recklessness; that was
just plain cautiousness. If you had seen the
way he came sliding and slinking toward you
in the darkness, you wouldn&rsquo;t be so touched by
the little tussle I gave him. People don&rsquo;t
sneak around looking for mislaid magazines&mdash;they
stamp around and yell like the dickens.
I know I do. Besides, he made no attempt to
take the magazine; his browned and nicely
manicured hand shot straight for your inner
coat pocket and I don&rsquo;t mean maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hal, you&rsquo;re unjust&mdash;you&rsquo;re....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Unk,&rdquo; Hal interposed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
that bad, honest. I know what I saw, and believe
me I&rsquo;d rather think that he didn&rsquo;t want
to go for your inner pocket. But he did! If
he was so bent on getting the magazine and if
his feelings were ruffled to the point that he
made out they were, how is it he went off
without it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the magazine. There it is alongside
of you, right where it was all along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is, Hal.&rdquo; Denis Keen thrust his long
fingers down between the canvas and the woodwork
and brought forth the disputed magazine.
He studied it for a moment, shaking his
long, slim head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, do you still think it doesn&rsquo;t look
mighty funny, Unk?&rdquo; Hal asked in smiling
triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hal, my dear boy, there&rsquo;s an element of
doubt in everything&mdash;most everything. You&rsquo;ll
learn that quickly enough if you follow in my
footsteps. And as for this particular incident&mdash;well,
you must realize that Se&ntilde;or Goncalves
suffered insult at your hands. You admitted
yourself his feelings were ruffled. Well then,
is it not perfectly plausible that he could have
forgotten the magazine because of his great
stress? I dare say that anyone would forget
the object of his visit in the face of that unjust
accusation. Se&ntilde;or Goncalves was thinking
only of his wounded pride when he bid us
goodnight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Hal with a contemptuous
sniff, &ldquo;and maybe not. Anyway, I&rsquo;ve got to
hand it to you, Unk, for thinking the best of
that little Brazil-nut. You want to see things
for yourself, huh? Well, I&rsquo;ve got a hunch
you&rsquo;ll see all you want of that bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could he possibly know or want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Unk,&rdquo; Hal answered, lowering his
voice instinctively, &ldquo;the Brazilian Government
must have a few leaks in it the same as
any other government. They invited the U. S.
to send you down here to co&ouml;perate with them
in hunting down the why and wherefore of
this smuggling firearms business, didn&rsquo;t they?
Well, what&rsquo;s to stop a few outsiders from finding
out where and when you&rsquo;re traveling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good logic, Hal,&rdquo; Denis Keen smiled.
&ldquo;You think there must be informers in the
government here giving out a tip or two to the
rebel men, eh? In other words, you think that
perhaps our dapper Se&ntilde;or Carlo Goncalves is
a rebel spy, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>&ldquo;Righto, Unk, old scout. And I think that
Brazil-nut was trying to pick your pocket&mdash;I
do! Listen, Unk, have you any papers you
wouldn&rsquo;t care about losing right now, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One, and it&rsquo;s my letter of introduction
from Rio to the interventor (he&rsquo;s a sort of
Governor, I believe) of <i>Manaos</i>. It&rsquo;s a polite
and lengthy document, in code of course, asking
his help in securing a suitable retinue for
our journey into the interior after that scamp
Renan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Renan!</i>&rdquo; Hal breathed admiringly. &ldquo;Gosh,
Unk, that fellow&rsquo;s name just makes me want
to meet him even if he is being hunted by
two countries for smuggling ammunition to
Brazilian rebels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s merely wanted in connection with the
smuggling, Hal. Naturally he takes no actual
part in it. He merely exercises his gracious
personality in forcing unscrupulous American
munitions manufacturers to enter into his
illegal plans. Renan is a soldier of fortune
from what I can understand. No one seems
to know whether he&rsquo;s English or American&mdash;it
is certain that he&rsquo;s either one or the other.
But everyone is agreed that he&rsquo;s a man of
mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>It was then that they became aware of a
figure moving in the shadows aft. Hal jumped
from his chair and was after it in a flash.
However, the figure eluded him, and though
he searched the deck and near saloon for a full
five minutes he returned without a clue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a soul anywhere, Unk,&rdquo; he announced
breathlessly, &ldquo;I circled the whole blame deck
too. Didn&rsquo;t even run into a sailor. Funny.
Were we talking very loud that time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not above a whisper. Hardly that. I dare
say one would have had to come right up to
our chairs to catch a word. Regardless of
your hunches, Hal, I never take chances in
talking&mdash;not anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know&mdash;I just thought maybe ... say,
Unk, is the Brazil-nut&rsquo;s cabin the fourth one
from ours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe so. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just that there wasn&rsquo;t a light or anything.
But then, maybe he went to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even a Brazilian like Se&ntilde;or Goncalves has
to go to bed, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal smiled good-naturedly at the playful
thrust and shook back an errant lock of hair
from his forehead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, Unk, my impression of him is that
he goes to bed when other people don&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t
ask me why I think it. I couldn&rsquo;t tell you.
That bird is a riddle to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re going to solve him yourself, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; asked Hal. He laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
to, but, who knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who, indeed!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">AN INTRUDER</span></h2>
<p>As they undressed for bed they heard the
throb of the engines cease and, after the captain
gave some orders in blatant Portuguese,
the boat slowed down and stopped. An obliging
steward informed Hal that they were anchoring
at the entrance to the Narrows, waiting
for daybreak before they dared pass
through its tiny channels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that means we&rsquo;ll have a nice, quiet
night to sleep,&rdquo; said Denis Keen, stifling a
yawn. &ldquo;Those engines are the noisiest things
in Christendom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal undressed with alacrity and said nothing
until after he had crawled into his bunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You feel all right about everything, huh,
Unk?&rdquo; he asked thoughtfully. &ldquo;That is&mdash;I
mean you don&rsquo;t think that these revolutionary
fellows would have any reason to get after
you, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Denis Keen laid his shoes aside carefully
and then got into the bunk above his nephew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mind&rsquo;s at peace with all the world,&rdquo;
he chuckled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interested in the revolutionary
fellows&mdash;I&rsquo;m interested in trailing
down Renan to find out how, when and where
he gets in communication with American munitions
men. That&rsquo;s my job, Hal. It&rsquo;s the
American munitions men that the U. S. government
will eventually handle satisfactorily,
and I&rsquo;ve got to find who they are. As for
Renan&mdash;if he&rsquo;s a U. S. citizen and we can get
him on U. S. territory&mdash;well, so much the better.
But if not, Brazil has reason enough to
hold him, and if I can help them to do it, I
will. Of course, in sifting things down to a
common denominator, the Brazilian rebels
wouldn&rsquo;t have any reason to think kindly of
me. My presence in their country is a warning
that their munitions supply will shortly be
cut off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the Brazil-nut&mdash;if he is a spy, would
have reason enough to want to find out what
you know, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;If he is a spy, he would. If he could decipher
my letter he would find out that the
Brazilian Government has reason to believe
that Renan is in a jungle spot many miles
back from the <i>Rio Yauapery</i>. It is in a section
still inhabited by wild tribes. But Renan
wouldn&rsquo;t worry about a little thing like that.
If he&rsquo;s visiting General Jao Ceara, commanding
the rebel forces, then the savage element is
twofold. From all accounts, Ceara&rsquo;s got a
wild lot of men&mdash;half-castes for the most part&mdash;he&rsquo;s
one himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man, and we&rsquo;ve got to go to a place like
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not. If I know these half-castes as
well as I think I do, they can be bribed into
giving me a little information. In that way I
can find out when and where the next munitions
shipment is due and lo, to trace the
rest of the story, both before and after, will be
comparatively easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so, Unk. Gosh, there&rsquo;s promise of
thrills, though, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some. We&rsquo;ve been promised adequate
military protection. We&rsquo;re to work out of
<i>Manaos</i>. Now I&rsquo;ve told you all I know, Hal,
so put your mind at rest for the night. My
precious code letter is safe in my pajama
pocket. Go to sleep. I can hardly talk, I&rsquo;m so
drowsy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Hal stretched out and, after pounding his
pillow into a mound, lay down. He could
catch a glimpse of the deck rail through the
tiny window and watched the shadows playing
upon it from the mooring lights, fore and aft.</p>
<p>A deep, languorous silence enveloped the
clumsy boat, and now and again Hal caught
a whiff of the damp, warm jungle in the faint
breeze that blew about his curly head. It gave
him pause, that smell of jungle, and in his
mind he went many times over every detail of
what his uncle had told him concerning Renan,
that colorful man of mystery who was even
then hidden away in a savage stronghold.</p>
<p>The thought of it was fascinating to an adventurous
young man like Hal and he felt
doubly glad that he had given up the prospect
of a mild summer in the north woods for this
strange and hazardous journey on the Amazon.
He closed his eyes to try and visualize
it more clearly and was soon fast asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>His dreams were vivid, fantastic things in
which he did much breathless chasing through
trackless jungle after hundreds of bayonets.
That the bayonets were animate, breathing
things did not seem to surprise him in the
least. Neither did he feel any consternation
that this vast army of firearms should suddenly
resolve itself into one human being who
quickly overpowered him and stood guard over
his supine body.</p>
<p>Ever so gradually his subconscious being
was aroused to an awareness that another
presence was standing over him and looking
down upon his sleeping countenance. Startled
by this realization, Hal became suddenly alert.
He felt a little chilled to lie there trying to
feign sleep while he thought out what move he
should make first.</p>
<p>Suddenly, however, he knew that this alien
presence was no longer beside him. He heard
not a sound until the door creaked and in a
second he was on his feet shouting after the
fleeing intruder.</p>
<p>A sailor came running and at Hal&rsquo;s orders
he continued the chase while the excited young
man hurried back into the cabin to get his
shoes. Denis Keen was by that time
thoroughly aroused and on his feet.</p>
<p>Hal explained the situation in a few words
while he pulled on his shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I surprised him, Unk&mdash;just in
time,&rdquo; he said breathlessly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just in time to see him get away,&rdquo; said
Denis Keen significantly. &ldquo;My pajama
pocket....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, Unk....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That my letter has been stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">PIZELLA, THE INSCRUTABLE</span></h2>
<p>Before Hal had recovered from his astonishment,
there burst into the cabin, the
sailor, who was leading a cringing, ratlike little
man. Behind them came the captain, wringing
his hands excitedly and talking in vociferous
Portuguese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many pardons, Se&ntilde;ors!&rdquo; said he, bowing
apologetically. &ldquo;This half-caste, Pizella&mdash;he
come up from steerage to rob you&mdash;yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been robbed of something important,&rdquo;
Denis Keen answered and explained in
Spanish the importance of his letter.</p>
<p>The captain was irate with the half-caste,
Pizella, and with the aid of the sailor proceeded
to search him most thoroughly. But
this availed them nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo; Hal asked. He glanced at the
sailor. &ldquo;You sure this is the bird I told you
to beat it after?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Most certain, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; the sailor assured
him. &ldquo;I caught him half-way down the
stairway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmph,&rdquo; said Denis Keen, &ldquo;question him,
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few more minutes ensued in which the
captain and the sailor took turns at arguing
with the man in an unintelligible patois. But
nothing came of this either, for the half-caste
protested that he was entirely innocent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what can we do?&rdquo; the captain beseeched
Denis Keen. &ldquo;We find nothing stolen
on Pizella, the young Se&ntilde;or Hal does not
know sure that it was he in the cabin&mdash;he
admits it very truly when he asks the sailor
was he sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very true, Captain,&rdquo; said Denis
Keen. &ldquo;My nephew could not swear to it that
this man was the intruder, can you, Hal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal could not. A fair-sized group of upper
deck passengers had gathered about their
cabin door listening to the singular conversation.
At the head of them stood Se&ntilde;or Carlo
Goncalves in a state of partial dishabille and
listening attentively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>When Denis Keen had dismissed the
wretched Pizella because of lack of evidence,
the dapper Brazilian came forward twisting
his little waxed moustache and smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you have lost not so very much&mdash;yes?&rdquo;
he asked sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; Denis Keen smiled. &ldquo;Just
a letter, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Se&ntilde;or Goncalves looked astonished, then
comprehending.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but the letter is important&mdash;no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Denis Keen smiled, &ldquo;it is important.
You know nothing about this man Pizella?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing except he is half-caste and that
speaks much, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Goncalves genially.
&ldquo;They do quite funny things, these half-castes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such as <i>espionage</i>?&rdquo; Denis Keen asked
quietly, yet forcefully.</p>
<p>Hal watched the dapper Brazilian narrowly,
but caught not one betraying movement.
The man&rsquo;s swarthy face showed only a
sincere concern that these aliens should be distressed
in his beloved country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The half-castes they are all rebels perhaps,&rdquo;
said the man at length. &ldquo;But that they
should bother the Se&ntilde;ors&mdash;ah, it is deplorable.
For why should the half-caste Pizella....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he had reason to believe I had
something to do with your government,&rdquo; interposed
Denis Keen. &ldquo;I have&mdash;as a friendly
neighbor. But my letter&mdash;it was one of introduction
to the interventor at <i>Manaos</i>. With
his aid I am to get together a party suitable to
my purpose. I am interested in anthropology,
Se&ntilde;or, just a dilettante, of course, and my
nephew, Hal, inherits the curse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Se&ntilde;or Goncalves laughed with great gusto
and twisted his tiny moustache until each end
resembled sharp pin points.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but that is interesting, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said he
genially. &ldquo;But as for your letter&mdash;ah, it is
nothing, for I myself know the interventor&mdash;I
can take you to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is indeed kind, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Denis
Keen relaxing. &ldquo;Very kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, it is nothing, Se&ntilde;ors, quite nothing.
I should be delighted to help my neighbor
Americanos on their interesting journey into
the Unknown. And now shall we enjoy the
rest of the journey to <i>Manaos</i>&mdash;no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Denis Keen chuckled. &ldquo;We shall
indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Hal smiled wryly&mdash;he was still smiling
when the Se&ntilde;or had bowed himself out of their
cabin to dress for breakfast. Denis Keen observed
him carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to be laughing up your sleeve,
as usual, Hal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, Unk. It&rsquo;s a case of the noise is
ended but the suspicion lingers on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just hopeless, Hal. I watched the
man closely&mdash;so did you. Besides, he is
acquainted with the interventor and that
serves my purpose. I shall have no further
use for the Se&ntilde;or, once I get an audience with
the interventor. He&rsquo;ll know no more about us
than he does now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that gives him a pretty wide margin,
Unk. Wasn&rsquo;t it telling him a lot just to say
you missed that letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. Most Americans on such expeditions
as it is believed we contemplate
secure letters of introduction along their
itinerary. The dapper chap is just a former
prosperous man forced by circumstances to go
trading into the interior for rubber as his only
means of livelihood. He&rsquo;s a jolly chap, you
must admit, and with an inherent sense of
hospitality. And as for any continued suspicion
of him, Hal, you saw with your own
eyes that he was in pajamas and dressing
gown, while you are sure that the man who
ran from this cabin was fully dressed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true, Unk. Oh, I guess I&rsquo;m
just a bug on hunches. I&rsquo;ll try and forget it,
because I do admit the Brazil-nut&rsquo;s a friendly
little guy&mdash;yes, he isn&rsquo;t half bad for a shipmate.
But I would like to know about that
letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wouldn&rsquo;t? It&rsquo;s futile to wonder,
though. I&rsquo;m convinced that the little Pizella
isn&rsquo;t what he looks. I think he took the letter
all right, but my idea is that he&rsquo;s either hidden
it or thrown it into the river before the sailor
caught him at the foot of the stairs. But our
chances for holding him were nil when you
couldn&rsquo;t identify him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I in the dark and when he ran
so fast, too?&rdquo; Hal protested. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t say
it honestly even if I felt I was right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. But put it out of your mind.
The captain has promised to have Pizella
watched closely for the rest of the voyage.
Now let&rsquo;s hurry and dress so we can get breakfast
over with. The Se&ntilde;or promised me yesterday
afternoon that he&rsquo;d escort me below
this morning. He&rsquo;s going to explain in his inimitable
way two or three quite interesting
looking half-castes that I happened to spot
down in the steerage yesterday. He seems to
have a knack for worming historical facts out
of people. He did that with a Colombian
sailor who was stationed up forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, look out he doesn&rsquo;t worm any historical
facts out of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They laughed over this together and finished
dressing. Breakfast followed, and when they
strolled out on deck to meet the dapper
Brazilian, the steamer was chugging her way
through the Narrows.</p>
<p>They spent an interesting hour down in the
steerage with the vivacious Brazilian, then
lingered at the deck rail there to view the surrounding
forest which all but brushed the ship
on either side. At times it seemed as if the
jungle had closed in and was trying to choke
them, and that they were writhing out of its
clutches, struggling ahead with heroic effort.</p>
<p>Hal felt stifled at the scene and said so.
Se&ntilde;or Goncalves was at once all concern.
They would return to the upper deck immediately
he said and proceeded to lead the way,
when the half-caste, Pizella, shuffled into
sight. Instinctively they stopped, waiting for
him to pass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>He glanced at them all in his shiftless, sullen
way&mdash;first at Denis Keen and then at Hal.
Suddenly his dark little eyes rested on the
Brazilian, then quickly dropped. In a moment,
he had disappeared around the other
side of the deck.</p>
<p>Not a word passed among them concerning
the wretched-looking creature and Hal followed
the others to the upper deck in silence.
He was thinking, however, and greatly
troubled. Try as he would, he could not repress
that small questioning voice within.</p>
<p>Was there any significance in the glance
that passed between the half-caste and Goncalves?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">A DECK CHASE</span></h2>
<p>By nightfall they had wormed their way
out of the Narrows and came at last to the
main stream of the Amazon River. Hal had
his first glimpse of it shortly after evening
coffee when he strolled out on deck alone. His
uncle preferred reading a long-neglected book
in the cabin until bedtime.</p>
<p>Hal stood with his elbows resting on the
polished rail and placidly puffed a cigarette.
The setting sun in all its glory was imprisoned
behind a mass of feathery clouds and reflected
in the dark yellow water surging under the
steamer&rsquo;s bow.</p>
<p>The day had been a pleasant one and Hal
had been untroubled by the morning&rsquo;s haunting
doubts. Se&ntilde;or Goncalves was proving to
be more and more a thoroughly good fellow
and pleasant shipmate. There was nothing to
worry about and, had it not been for the singular
disappearance of his uncle&rsquo;s letter, all
would be well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>But he tried not to let that disturb his
placidity, and fixed his dreamy glance on the
dense, low-lying forest stretching along the
river bank in an unbroken wall of trees. Being
at the end of the rainy season, the jungle
seemed more than ever impenetrable because
of the water covering the roots and creeping
far up the trunks of the trees.</p>
<p>A monkey swung high in the bough of a distant
tree, a few macaws and parrots hovered
near by seeking a perch for the night. Then
the fleecy clouds faded into the deep turquoise
heavens and the shadows of night stole out
from the jungle and crept on over the surging
Amazon.</p>
<p>The formidable shriek of a jaguar floated
down on the breeze, leaving a curious metallic
echo in its wake. When that had died away
Hal was conscious of a melancholy solitude enveloping
the steamer. Not a soul but himself
occupied that end of the deck; everyone else
seemed to be in the saloon, playing cards and
smoking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>He yawned sleepily and sought the seclusion
of a deck chair that stood back in the shadow
of a funnel. He would have a smoke or two,
then go in and join his uncle with a book.</p>
<p>He had no sooner settled himself, however,
than he heard the soft swish of a footstep coming
up the stair. It struck him at once as not
being that of a seaman&rsquo;s sturdy, honest tread.
It sounded too cautious and secretive, and
though he was curious as to who it might be,
he was too lazy to stir in his comfortable chair
and find out. But when the footstep sounded
on the last step and pattered upon the deck in
a soft, shiftless tread, Hal was suddenly
aroused.</p>
<p>He leaned forward in the chair and got a
flashing glimpse of Pizella&rsquo;s face as he disappeared
around the bow toward port side.</p>
<p>Hal was on his feet and stole cautiously
after him. He was certain that the man hadn&rsquo;t
seen him, yet, when he got around on the deck,
the fellow was almost aft. It was then that
he turned for a moment and, after looking
back, darted about to the other side again.</p>
<p>Hal chased him in earnest then, leaping
along in great strides until he came back to
where he had started. Pizella was not to be
seen, however, neither down the stairway nor
anywhere about the upper deck, which the
irate young man circled again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>After a futile search, Hal strolled past the
saloon. Se&ntilde;or Goncalves was one of the many
passengers in there making merry and contributing
his share to the sprightly entertainment.
In point of fact, the dapper Brazilian
was the proverbial &ldquo;life of the party&rdquo; and his
soft, purring voice preceded several outbursts
of laughter.</p>
<p>Hal went on and he had no sooner got out of
earshot of the merrymakers when he heard a
door close up forward. Even as he looked, he
recognized Pizella&rsquo;s small figure going toward
the stairway. He knew it was the half-caste;
that time he could have sworn to it, yet....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">A STORY OF THE PAST</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;He swore up and down that he wasn&rsquo;t
near this deck,&rdquo; Hal declared vehemently,
when he got back to his uncle&rsquo;s cabin ten minutes
later. &ldquo;No one in the steerage saw him
come up or come down. I was the only one
who saw him slinking around up here&mdash;I know
it was him this time, Unk! But the sailors
below thought I was seeing things I guess, for
when I got down there, friend Pizella had his
shoes and trousers off and was stretched out
in his bunk as nice as you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange, strange,&rdquo; murmured Denis Keen,
putting his book down on the night table beside
his elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it is. The way I figured it, he must
have started peeling off on his way down. Undressing
on the wing, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;It would seem so, Hal. Your very earnestness
convinces me that it was no mere hunch
you acted upon this time. The fellow is up
to something&mdash;that&rsquo;s a certainty. But he
wasn&rsquo;t anywhere near this cabin. I heard not
a sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Brazil-nut was strutting his stuff
in the saloon, so he&rsquo;s out of the picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s something to feel comfortable
about.&rdquo; Denis Keen laughed. &ldquo;Surely you
didn&rsquo;t think....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unk, when there&rsquo;s sneaking business going
around like this that you can&rsquo;t explain or even
lay one&rsquo;s finger on, why, one is likely to suspect
everybody. Anyway, I guess they&rsquo;ll keep
closer watch on him just to get rid of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt they&rsquo;re beginning to suspect that
you have some reason for picking on Pizella.
Either that or they&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;re suffering
from a Pizella complex. But in any case, Hal,
I think it won&rsquo;t do a bit of harm to have the
man watched in <i>Manaos</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>They forgot about Pizella for the rest of the
voyage, however, mainly because Pizella did
not again appear above decks. Hal quickly
forgot his hasty suspicions and was lost in the
charm of the country on either side of the
river. The landscape changed two days after
they entered the Amazon, and in place of the
low-lying swamps, a series of hills, the <i>Serra
Jutahy</i>, rose to their right.</p>
<p>After leaving the hills behind, they caught
a brief glimpse of two settlements, larger and
more important than most of those they had
seen. The captain pointed out the first of
these, <i>Santarem</i>, which lay near the junction
of the Amazon and <i>Tapajos</i>, the latter an important
southern tributary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Santarem</i>,&rdquo; the captain obligingly explained,
&ldquo;should interest the Se&ntilde;ors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Hal asked immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is full of the romance of a lost cause,&rdquo;
said the captain. &ldquo;After the Civil War in your
great United States, a number of the slave-owning
aristocracy, who refused to admit defeat
and bow their heads to Yankee rule, came
and settled in this far-away corner of the
Amazon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tremendous venture,&rdquo; said Denis Keen.
&ldquo;I dare say their task was too much for
them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;For some, Se&ntilde;or. Some of them returned
to your fair country broken in body and spirit,
but others held on. Only a very few of the
older generation live, but there are the sons
and grandsons and great-grandsons to carry
on&mdash;yes? A few of these families&mdash;they have
scattered up this stream&mdash;down that stream.
One of them that is perhaps interesting more
than the others is the Pemberton family.
Everyone familiar with the Amazon has heard
their sad story. It began when Marcellus
Pemberton, the first, settled in <i>Santarem</i>
along with several other old families from
Virginia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marcellus Pemberton, eh?&rdquo; said Denis
Keen. &ldquo;That certainly smacks of Old Virginia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a very bitter man, the first Marcellus
Pemberton. A very young man when
he went to fight against the North, he fled
from his home after the War rather than bow
to Yankee rule. He settled in <i>Santarem</i> with
other Virginia families, took a wife from one
of them, and had many children. All died but
his youngest son&mdash;even his wife got the fever
and died. Marcellus and his youngest son left
the settlement then and went to live a little
way up the <i>Rio Pallida Mors</i>. And so it is
with that son that the story centers, even
though he married an American se&ntilde;orita from
<i>Santarem</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;And they had a son, huh?&rdquo; Hal asked interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Se&ntilde;or Hal. But of him I know little&mdash;the
grandson. It is as I said Old Marcellus&rsquo;
son who is interest&mdash;yes? Ten years ago he
disappeared mysteriously. His wife died
heartbroken a little later and left behind the
girl Felice, a fair flower in the jungle wilderness,
and the grandson who must now be
twenty-five. Felice, like the good girl she is,
stays with her grandfather who is now getting
very old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose they&rsquo;re as poor as the dickens,
huh?&rdquo; Hal queried. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re starving
to death I bet, and yet I suppose they&rsquo;re keeping
up the old tradition. Pride, and all that.
They ought to know the war is forgotten.
Peace and good will ought to be their motto
and bring them back to the U. S.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too true, Se&ntilde;or Hal,&rdquo; the captain agreed,
&ldquo;but they do not stay for that, I do not think.
They stay because of an uncertainty and that
is the sad part of the story. I did not tell you
how the Se&ntilde;or Marcellus, Junior, died ten
years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I thought this wouldn&rsquo;t end without
Hal getting the pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance out of the
story,&rdquo; Denis Keen chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I notice you&rsquo;re listening intently
yourself,&rdquo; said Hal good-naturedly. &ldquo;Go on,
Captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said the captain amiably.
&ldquo;It takes but a moment to tell you that Se&ntilde;or
Marcellus was looking for gold up the <i>Rio
Pallida Mors</i> (<i>Pale Death</i>)&mdash;most people call
it <i>Dead River</i>, Se&ntilde;ors. One day he started
out prepared for his long journey to his lode
and he stopped a moment to tell his wife to
promise him that, if some day he did not
come back, they would not rest until they
found his body. He had what you call a presentiment&mdash;no?
But his wife she promised
and the children promised, also his father.
So he went and as he feared he did not return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they never found him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, Se&ntilde;or Hal. Neither did they find
where his lode had gone. To this day they
have found neither him nor the mine. And
so they look always for his body. The Indians
they say he has come back from death in
the form of a jaguar and every moonlight
night he shrieks along the banks of the river,
crying for his children or his father to come
and find his body in the rushing waters of
<i>Pallida Mors</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tragic story, Captain,&rdquo; said Denis
Keen. &ldquo;They must be an unhappy group up
there, being reminded of their father&rsquo;s sad
ending every time there&rsquo;s a moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something spooky about him being reincarnated
in jaguar form, huh? Gosh, they
don&rsquo;t believe that part of it, this Pemberton
family, do they, Captain?&rdquo; Hal asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no. They cannot even believe he is
really dead, Se&ntilde;ors&mdash;they say they <i>won&rsquo;t</i> believe
it till they find his body. And so they
wait and the jaguar shrieks on moonlight
nights. But <i>Santarem</i> is long in the distance,
Se&ntilde;ors&mdash;the story is ended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the Pembertons, I guess,&rdquo; said
Hal sympathetically. &ldquo;Gosh blame it, I&rsquo;d
like to help those poor people find that man
so&rsquo;s they could get away and live like civilized
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said his uncle, after the captain
had left them quite alone, &ldquo;that you have
enough on your hands right now. What with
your worries about Pizella, my future worries
about tracing these munitions to Renan,
I think we have sufficient for two human
minds.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, we could tackle this Pemberton business
afterward, couldn&rsquo;t we, Unk? Even if
we just stopped to pay them a friendly visit.
Gol darn it, I should think they&rsquo;d be tickled
silly to talk to a couple of sympathetic Americans
after living in the wilderness and surrounded
by savages all their....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take it this <i>Pallida Mors</i> will have you
for a visit, come sunshine or storm, eh, Hal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how! A nice little surprise visit to
the Pembertons,&rdquo; Hal mused delightedly.</p>
<p>Destiny thought differently about it evidently,
for Hal was the one to be surprised,
not the Pembertons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">A FAMILIAR FOLLOWER</span></h2>
<p>They departed from the main stream and
proceeded up the black waters of the <i>Rio
Negro</i> just after sunrise. <i>Manaos</i>, with its
modern buildings, crowded streets and electric
lights, was indeed a &ldquo;city lost in the jungle,&rdquo;
for a half mile beyond the city limits, the
jungle, primeval and inviolable, lay like a vast
green canvas under the sparkling sunlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one in the city knows what is in that
forest twenty miles away,&rdquo; Se&ntilde;or Goncalves
informed Hal and his uncle as they drew into
the wharf. &ldquo;<i>Manaos</i> does not care to know,
Se&ntilde;ors, for she prefers to be a little New York
and forget the naked savages that roam the
forests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me, I wouldn&rsquo;t forget the naked
savages if I was a <i>Manaosan</i>,&rdquo; said Hal earnestly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d take hikes into the jungle and
see what was doing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is understood, Hal,&rdquo; laughed his
uncle. &ldquo;But there are few <i>Manaosans</i>, if any,
that are cursed with your snoopiness. Life
apparently means much to them and they are
far too wise to risk that precious gift just to
find out what the wild, naked savage is doing
in his own jungle. You don&rsquo;t mean to tell me
that you are adding the suburbs of <i>Manaos</i>
to your already overcrowded itinerary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Unk, I&rsquo;m going to see all there is
to see and you can&rsquo;t blame me. Gol darn it,
this is my first trip to Brazil and the Amazon,
and I&rsquo;ve only got a few months to see it in.
Boy, it&rsquo;s the chance of a lifetime maybe, so
why miss anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dapper Brazilian twisted his trim little
moustache and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Se&ntilde;or Hal he has the right idea, Se&ntilde;or
Keen,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He goes in for&mdash;what you
call it&mdash;sport? Ah, but that is well. So I
shall show him places&mdash;no? There are the
movies to go to&mdash;even you shall see this afternoon
a fine aviation field where is a great
friend of mine, Jos&eacute; Rodriguez. He is what
you Americans call the <i>Ace</i>&mdash;yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh,&rdquo; Hal said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d think it was immense
to meet a Brazilian Ace. Think he&rsquo;d
like to take us up for a spin around?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that is just what I was going to suggest,
Se&ntilde;or Hal. He is very kind, Jos&eacute;. Perhaps
you would like him to take you for the
spin over the <i>Manaos</i> jungle, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great&mdash;<i>immense</i>!&rdquo; Hal enthused. &ldquo;You
do think of things, Goncalves&mdash;I&rsquo;ll say that
for you! So we start this afternoon, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, Se&ntilde;or Hal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was something to look forward to and
Hal did all of that while the amiable Se&ntilde;or
escorted his uncle to <i>Manaos&rsquo;</i> best hotel. The
trials of registering and selecting comfortable
rooms always bored him and he preferred returning
to the hostelry when all those formalities
were over with.</p>
<p>Consequently, Hal strolled through the busy
little city after having breakfast at a quaint
coffee house. Up one street and down another,
he ambled along with a grace that attracted
attention wherever he went. Clad in
white polo shirt, immaculate flannels and sport
shoes, his splendid, towering physique and
crown of red-gold hair stood out in bold relief
against the short, dark-skinned <i>Manaosans</i>.
More than one dusky damosel arrayed in New
York&rsquo;s latest fashion allowed herself a second
glance at him in passing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>But Hal was invulnerable where the <i>Manaos</i>
maidens were concerned. His weakness was
adventure. Also, during the first part of his
stroll he was too interested in watching the
thousands of Amazonian vultures which
hovered overhead. Garden after garden was
crowded with strange birds: egrets with their
delicate feathers, duckbills, curious snipe with
claws in the bend of their wings, and parrots
shrieking in an alien tongue as he passed.</p>
<p>Once he stopped to observe a blustering
<i>jaribu</i>, or Amazonian heron, who was trying
to lord it over two gorgeously plumed egrets.
Suddenly he was aware of a shadow behind
him, and when he turned he saw Pizella not
ten feet distant. Hal swung completely about
and faced the half-caste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; he said calmly, &ldquo;following
me, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pizella was inscrutable. He did not even
slacken his shambling pace and as he caught
up with Hal his shifty eyes were expressionless
and seemed not to see his questioner. In
point of fact, he even made so bold as to attempt
to pass right by.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>But Hal would have none of it. He leaned
down from his great height and closed his
large, slim hand tightly over the man&rsquo;s scruff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was talking to you, Pizella,&rdquo; he said
quietly. &ldquo;Maybe you can&rsquo;t understand my
language, but, by heck, you can understand
what my hand means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pizella&rsquo;s face never changed. He glanced
up at Hal in that same expressionless manner
as if he neither heard nor understood. To
make matters worse a crowd began to gather
and in a couple of seconds there was such a
pushing, babbling and confusion that the half-caste
got away.</p>
<p>Hal pushed through the throng after him
but was destined to disappointment. Pizella
was nowhere in sight. Gardens to the right of
him, gardens to the left of him&mdash;the man might
have escaped through any number of them.
In any event, he was not to be found.</p>
<p>After searching for almost two hours, Hal
turned back to the hotel, thoughtful and
troubled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">HUNCHES</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to look downright serious, Unk,&rdquo;
Hal said, after entering their rooms in the
hotel. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just a coincidence, my meeting
him like that, or he wouldn&rsquo;t have pulled
away when he saw his chance. Why wasn&rsquo;t
he reported to the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The captain promised me he would attend
to it, Hal. Apparently he didn&rsquo;t. I myself
saw Pizella not fifteen minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Goncalves has a room on the next
floor,&rdquo; Denis Keen explained. &ldquo;I had occasion
to think that perhaps I could get him to
give me that letter to His Excellency, the interventor,
this afternoon and I went up. Just
as I got to the Se&ntilde;or&rsquo;s room, whom was he
showing out the door but Pizella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Unk!</i> You....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute before you come to conclusions.
I did. Goncalves acted annoyed more
than surprised&mdash;I would even go so far as to
say that he was somewhat agitated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With you coming unexpectedly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He directed a flow of abuse at the departing
Pizella&rsquo;s head. Told him not to show his
nose around there again and words to that
effect. Then, with his usual cheeriness and
perfect hospitality, he invited me in and told
me that Pizella had the brass to seek him out
and ask him for a job as guide on his expedition.
So that explained it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think about it, Unk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; Denis Keen chuckled, and
rose to fleck some ashes from his cigarette.
&ldquo;Perhaps that poor devil has really been seeking
a job as guide right along. Perhaps that
is why he did all that sneaking around the
boat&mdash;one can&rsquo;t get much out of him. He
seems hopelessly ignorant and yet there&rsquo;s always
that sullen look and shifty eye to consider....
Oh, well, he&rsquo;s either one thing or
the other&mdash;an ignorant half-caste or an exceedingly
clever half-caste. I&rsquo;d like to know
which.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A knock sounded at the door and at their
summons a boy entered with a note. Hal
took it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;From the Brazil-nut,&rdquo; he said after the
boy had gone. &ldquo;Very informal. He says:
&lsquo;Will the Se&ntilde;ors excuse me from accompanying
them to the field at two o&rsquo;clock this afternoon?
Business will detain me, but I beg of
the Se&ntilde;ors to not disappoint my very good
friend, Jos&eacute; Rodriguez, as he has made arrangements
and has set aside time to take you
up for the spin&mdash;yes? A car will come for
you at two, Se&ntilde;ors.... Regretfully....&rsquo;
He&rsquo;s signed his name with a flourish, Unk.
Well, it&rsquo;s up to us to put in our appearance
alone. I....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll put in <i>your</i> appearance alone,
Hal. I have no intention of going. I&rsquo;ve got
a more serious matter to attend to. Besides,
I&rsquo;m not keen about airplaning in any country&mdash;much
less this. I&rsquo;d be just as pleased if
you didn&rsquo;t go either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, Unk, you&rsquo;d think I was some kid.
Why, I can handle controls now like nobody&rsquo;s
business. Besides, this Rodriguez is an Ace!
Do you suppose anything&rsquo;s likely to happen
just because we&rsquo;re in Brazil? Gosh....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know, Hal. It&rsquo;s absurd, I suppose,
for me to object to your going, but I guess
you&rsquo;re wishing some of that accursed hunch
business on me. Something&rsquo;s making me feel
this way.&rdquo; He laughed uneasily. &ldquo;Perhaps
I&rsquo;m just a little upset about other matters.
Still, promise me you&rsquo;ll be careful&mdash;I could
never face your mother if anything happened
to you while you were with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unk, you&rsquo;re the limit! You&rsquo;d think I had
never set foot in a cockpit before! Why,
Mother&rsquo;s been up in the air with me. She
says I&rsquo;m a world beater and she&rsquo;s going to let
me try for my pilot&rsquo;s license next year. Why,
she came up with me twice when Bellair was
down on a visit to teach me. Gosh....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Hal,&rdquo; said Denis Keen, pacing
up and down the room. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re old enough
to know what you&rsquo;re doing, I suppose. This
Bellair&mdash;he&rsquo;s one of the famous brothers, eh?
Oh, I know they&rsquo;re considered expert airmen.
Glad to hear they&rsquo;ve taught you what you
know. Guess they could give you some fair
pointers as to what to do in a tight place, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;And how!&rdquo; Hal exclaimed with a wry
smile. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t teach anything else but.
They&rsquo;re stunters on a large scale, and if you
can&rsquo;t learn about planes from them, you&rsquo;ll
never learn. But why all these questions about
what I learned from the Bellairs, huh? Are
you really afraid I might get into a tight place
with an expert like this Rodriguez is supposed
to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, strangers, you know, Hal ...
methods are varied among airmen, aren&rsquo;t
they? Oh, I know you&rsquo;re laughing up your
sleeve. Now&rsquo;s your chance to poke fun at me
about hunches, eh? Well, I won&rsquo;t give in to it,
then. You go ahead. We&rsquo;ll have luncheon,
then I&rsquo;ll ride with you in the car that Se&ntilde;or
Goncalves has so generously sent for. The
mansion of His Excellency, the interventor, is
half-way toward the field, I&rsquo;ve been given to
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You going there this afternoon, Unk?
Why, I thought Goncalves was going to write
that letter and fix it for you to go there tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he changed all that when I saw him in
his room just a while ago. He told me he had
already telephoned the interventor, explaining
my want of guides and an interpreter, and
His Excellency, being terribly busy with the
affairs of State, requested Se&ntilde;or Goncalves
to arrange those matters himself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;In other words, the interventor doesn&rsquo;t
want to be bothered with you, huh, Unk? He
wants the Brazil-nut to do the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the dapper Se&ntilde;or told me in his inimitable
way. But the fly in the ointment is this&mdash;Goncalves
doesn&rsquo;t know that it is the duty
of the interventor to see <i>me</i>, neither does he
know that it is of paramount importance for
me to see His Excellency regarding Renan and
Ceara before I leave <i>Manaos</i>. His Excellency
apparently didn&rsquo;t understand who the American
Se&ntilde;or was whom Goncalves was trying to
tell him about. They assured me when I left
Rio that the interventor here would be notified
of my coming. So I&rsquo;m going this afternoon
and no one is to be enlightened as to my whereabouts&mdash;<i>no
one</i>! Understand, Hal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cross my heart and hope to die,&rdquo; Hal
laughed. &ldquo;Go to it, Unk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;Most assuredly I will. I&rsquo;ve got to see His
Excellency about getting Federal aid. Do you
know, Hal, I had the feeling when I was
talking with Goncalves in his room that he
wasn&rsquo;t any too anxious for me to see the interventor!
His attitude ... I don&rsquo;t know
... perhaps, I imagined that too. Come on,
let&rsquo;s wash up and get down to luncheon before
I hatch up some more hunches to worry
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unk,&rdquo; Hal laughed, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a chip off the
young block and I don&rsquo;t mean maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">A DUTCH UNCLE</span></h2>
<p>Hal got out of the car at the edge of <i>San
Gabriel</i> aviation field and looked about.
Leveled from the surrounding jungle, it was
situated at the extreme end of the city and
here and there over its smooth-looking surface
were divers planes, some throbbing under the
impetus of running engines and some still,
with their spread wings catching the reflection
of the afternoon sun.</p>
<p>Three good-sized hangars dotted the right
side of the field and Hal caught a glimpse of
mechanics busy within. Several groups of
men stood about chattering, while here and
there some nondescript individual loitered
about with that solitary air that at once proclaimed
him as being one of that universal
brotherhood of hoboes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>One, whose features were distinctly Anglo-Saxon,
despite the ravages which the South
American climate had made upon his once fair
skin, strolled over to Hal&rsquo;s side the moment he
espied him. He was hatless and his blond hair
had been burned by countless Brazilian suns
until it was a kind of burnt straw color. And
his clothes, though worn and thin, gave mute
testimony of the wearer having seen a far
happier and more prosperous era than the
present one.</p>
<p>Hal caught the look of racial hunger on his
face and warmed toward him immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, fellow,&rdquo; said he with a warmth in
his deep voice. &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Keen&mdash;Hal
Keen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A light shone from the stranger&rsquo;s gray eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmichael&rsquo;s mine, Keen,&rdquo; he said pleasantly.
&ldquo;Rene Carmichael. Awfully glad to
speak the English language with a fellow
being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Americans aren&rsquo;t speaking the English
language, Carmichael,&rdquo; Hal laughed with
a twinkle in his deep blue eyes. &ldquo;Nevertheless,
as long as you can understand me, that&rsquo;s
all that counts, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s music to my ears, Keen,&rdquo; answered
Carmichael gravely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s deucedly odd how
one will criticize Americans when one is safe
at home, but just get away in this corner of
nowhere and see the smiling face and broad
shoulders of a Yankee pop up out of this dark-skinned
crowd! I tell you, Keen, it makes a
chap like myself almost want to fall on your
shoulder and weep.&rdquo; His weather-beaten face
crinkled up in a smile, as he looked up at Hal.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t carry a stepladder around with
you so I can do that, eh?&rdquo; he asked whimsically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; Hal laughed. &ldquo;Notwithstanding
my height, I couldn&rsquo;t conceal it.&rdquo; He glanced
at Carmichael sympathetically. &ldquo;Funny
what you just said about Americans&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
thought that way about Englishmen too and
yet as soon as I laid eyes on you, I felt just
like you say you do. Kindred spirits and all
that sort of thing, huh? Anyway, I guess the
real trouble, the reason for all our prejudices
is that we dislike everything we don&rsquo;t know
and, consequently, can&rsquo;t understand, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now that you&rsquo;ve met a regular Englishman&mdash;what
is it, love at first sight?&rdquo; His
eyes danced with merriment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re aces high, Carmichael. I&rsquo;m tickled
pink we&rsquo;ve run into each other, that&rsquo;s a fact.
My uncle and I were supposed to look for a
Brazilian named Rodriguez out here who is
dated to take us for a spin. Unk couldn&rsquo;t
come, so here am I alone. How would you like
to take his place? I&rsquo;d feel better if you came
along&mdash;someone who can understand me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fellow studied Hal closely for a moment,
then nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come, but I shouldn&rsquo;t really. I&rsquo;m due
to sail for <i>Moura</i> at four. I&rsquo;ve got a toothbrush
and one or two other necessities of life
back at the hotel which I have to get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re not a ho ...&rdquo; Hal just
caught himself in time. &ldquo;Honestly, I&rsquo;m sorry,
awfully....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save the effort, Keen. I love to be thought
a hobo. As a matter of fact I am&mdash;in a sense.
I&rsquo;m very poor really, but I don&rsquo;t <i>have</i> to wear
my clothes as long as I&rsquo;ve worn this suit. It&rsquo;s
just that it suits my&mdash;ah, purpose.&rdquo; He
laughed and his voice was musically resonant.
&ldquo;Literally, though, I&rsquo;m not a hobo. I really
do <i>something</i> for a living, and a hard enough
living it is, old chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it,&rdquo; said Hal earnestly. He
studied the fellow a moment, taking note of
the buoyant broad shoulders and tall slender
figure. For he was really quite tall, when one
did not consider Hal&rsquo;s towering height.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re deucedly odd for what I&rsquo;ve heard
about Americans, Keen,&rdquo; said Carmichael.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re straightforward and honest, and not
a bit snoopy. Seem to take me at my face
value and all that. No questions&mdash;nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Hal countered. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t
be my business, Carmichael. But somebody&rsquo;s
given you a devil of an opinion of Americans!
I know there are some pretty poor specimens
that go shouting around in Europe, but there&rsquo;s
lots of the other kind too, and lots that stay at
home. Well, I guess I&rsquo;m the kind you haven&rsquo;t
heard about, huh? I&rsquo;m snoopy in some things,
though&mdash;don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we all?&rdquo; Carmichael returned.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the way of life and people, I suppose.
But there&rsquo;re some kinds that get on a chap&rsquo;s
nerves. Yours is the kind that doesn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s
why I want to tell you not to take seriously
what I gave you to understand about my being
from the continent. I&rsquo;ve lived all my life in
Brazil&mdash;perhaps that&rsquo;s why I like to play for
five minutes or so that I&rsquo;m really a native of
some other country. I was educated in an
English school in Rio and for eight happy
years I fooled myself that I was a citizen of
some Anglo-Saxon country. No doubt that
sounds deucedly odd coming from a chap born
here. But I shall never assimilate Latin ways
if I live to a ripe old age in this desolate corner
of the world.&rdquo; He laughed bitterly. &ldquo;I
can only hope then that I shall be allowed the
company of Anglo-Saxons in the spirit world,
eh, Keen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wish to live among Anglo-Saxons as
much as that, Carmichael, I should think
you&rsquo;d get your wish before you die.&rdquo; He
looked across the field and saw a short, helmeted
figure coming toward them. &ldquo;Don
Rodriguez, I bet. He&rsquo;s smiling, so that must
be he. He&rsquo;s smiling with recognition as if
he&rsquo;s been given a pretty accurate description
of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a description one could never forget,&rdquo;
said Carmichael. &ldquo;You must tell me more
about yourself, Keen&mdash;that is if you care to.
If all Americans are like you, then I want to
meet heaps of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve done so much for my
country,&rdquo; Hal laughed. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll tell you all
you want to hear. Wait until we get up in the
air&mdash;we&rsquo;ll have a little shouting party, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righto.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>The helmeted figure came straight to Hal
with outstretched hand and black, smiling
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Hal Keen&mdash;tall like a mountain and
red at the top,&rdquo; he said in broken English, and
laughed. Then he turned to Rene. &ldquo;And this
is the Se&ntilde;or uncle&mdash;no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Carmichael with a swift
chuckle, &ldquo;his Dutch uncle.&rdquo; And in an undertone
to Hal, he said: &ldquo;Do I look as old as
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It depends on how old looking you think
an uncle ought to look,&rdquo; Hal grinned. &ldquo;My
unk seems like a kid to me yet. He&rsquo;s not
forty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not thirty,&rdquo; said Carmichael
with a poignancy in his voice that did not
escape Hal. But he was all laughter the next
second and he added: &ldquo;At that I can still be
your Dutch uncle, eh? Your Uncle Rene?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell the world you can! <i>You are!</i>&rdquo;
Hal turned then to the still-smiling Rodriguez.
&ldquo;When do we hop off in your bus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, to be sure,&rdquo; said the aviator. &ldquo;The
plane, you mean, eh? She is there&mdash;see?&rdquo; he
said, pointing to a small, single-motor cabin
plane. &ldquo;Now shall we take a fly over the
jungle, you and the Se&ntilde;or uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; they answered unanimously. And
as they followed at the aviator&rsquo;s heels, Rene
whispered: &ldquo;I kind of like this, being your
Dutch uncle. And as long as he thinks so....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why bother to explain, huh?&rdquo; Hal returned
in the spirit of the thing. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
not that much difference between a real uncle
and a Dutch uncle anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Hal was to learn that there <i>was</i> a difference
as far as Rodriguez was concerned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">EXIT RENE</span></h2>
<p>When they got to the plane, Rodriguez proceeded
on into his cockpit, motioning his passengers
to make themselves comfortable in the
tiny cabin. After a moment they were off.</p>
<p>They bumped across the field, then rose into
the air, hesitated a moment as if they were
going to fly straight for the jungle, then soared
high into the blue. Hal nodded with satisfaction,
after a half hour had elapsed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some beautiful country,&rdquo; he shouted at
Carmichael. &ldquo;Like a big painted canvas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t think so if you got lost in
it,&rdquo; Rene shouted back. &ldquo;This fellow&rsquo;s taking
us for quite a long hop, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Hal nodded and looked out of the tiny window
down upon the endless sea of jungle over
which they were passing. The plane roared
on through the glistening blue and for a time
neither of the young men spoke. Yet they
were both aware of a peculiar sound coming
from the motor. It was not missing, yet each
revolution seemed more labored than the one
preceding it.</p>
<p>Rene looked at Hal questioningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve traveled in these things plenty, but I
don&rsquo;t know a thing about them. But I can
tell the thing isn&rsquo;t running perfectly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Hal roared across to his newly
found friend. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have trouble
in a sec and I don&rsquo;t mean maybe. If I could
talk to Rodriguez I could find out, but his
English is painful and my Portuguese hasn&rsquo;t
even begun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the difficulty, Hal,&rdquo; said Rene
unconsciously using the name with all the affection
of an old acquaintance, &ldquo;why, I can
help you out that way. I can speak Rodriguez,&rdquo;
he added with a conscious chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, that&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; said Hal. &ldquo;Come on,
we&rsquo;ll pile up there and you ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Brazilian seemed surprised to see his
two passengers appear in the narrow, low
doorway of his cockpit. In point of fact, Hal
sensed that he was even startled. The smile
that he gave them looked twisted and forced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Carmichael questioned him in Portuguese,
an undertaking which seemed interminable to
Hal. Meanwhile, the engine sounded worse
and after another second it began to miss.
They were in for trouble. Rodriguez&rsquo; gloomy
face augured the worst.</p>
<p>Hal noticed then with something of a start
that he was wearing a chute. Neither he nor
Carmichael had been asked to wear one and
he wondered why. It puzzled him greatly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask him what&rsquo;s the idea?&rdquo; Hal queried,
drawing Carmichael&rsquo;s attention to the pilot&rsquo;s
chute. &ldquo;Do we look like orphans? We&rsquo;re his
guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmichael stared at the chute, then
grabbed Rodriguez roughly by the shoulder
and a flow of Portuguese ensued. Suddenly
he turned back to Hal, his weather-beaten face
a little drawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all absurd excuses, Keen&mdash;he says he
didn&rsquo;t think to ask us if we wanted one. This
is the only one on this plane&mdash;the one he&rsquo;s
safely wearing. He also says the bus is
doomed&mdash;comforting news. We&rsquo;re no less
than two hundred miles from <i>Manaos</i> already
and there isn&rsquo;t a deuced place for him to land
in this jungle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then if he thinks we&rsquo;re doomed, why the
devil doesn&rsquo;t he turn back!&rdquo; Hal said impatiently.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea of continuing
north? Besides there <i>might</i> be a place we can
find if he&rsquo;s got the nerve to fly low enough to
see. There&rsquo;s a chance that we&rsquo;ll pancake and
get a bit banged up, of course, but it&rsquo;s better
than letting a bus crack up right under our
noses without us making any attempt to prevent
it! If you ask me&mdash;he&rsquo;s yellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking so too, Keen.&rdquo; Carmichael
frowned. &ldquo;You seem to know more about
planes than this chap&mdash;at least you use your
head in a pinch. What do you think the
chances are if we landed as you suggest. It&rsquo;s
dense jungle right below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could find a bit of a clearing we could
take it easy and let her go nose first. One
thing, I guess it&rsquo;s all swamp down there, huh?
Well, that&rsquo;s a help&mdash;it makes a softer berth.
But to answer your question&mdash;if we can find
a clearing large enough, there&rsquo;s a darn good
chance for us skinning through whole.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;But little chance of us getting out,&rdquo; said
Carmichael thoughtfully. &ldquo;I can answer that,
for I know the jungle. One of us ought to bail
out in that chute right away and take a chance
that this east wind blows him near enough to a
settlement so that help could be had. It&rsquo;s necessary
for one of us to go, Keen. Otherwise
we&rsquo;ll all be lost. As long as Rodriguez is
wearing the chute....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hal decisively, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll flip a
coin. Heads goes with the chute, tails stays.
It&rsquo;ll be between you and me, then between
Napoleon there and yourself. O. K.?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me. Here goes&mdash;I&rsquo;ll spin,&rdquo; said Carmichael,
taking a Brazilian coin out of his
pocket and flipping it in the air. &ldquo;Yours first,
Keen,&rdquo; he called as the coin came down on his
palm.</p>
<p>It was tails. Carmichael&rsquo;s flip brought
heads and with the next turn the pilot lost too.
Hal lost no time in ripping the chute from him
and adjusting it on Carmichael.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck to you, fellow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
try to find a spot as near here as possible.
Have you got our position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmichael nodded gravely. Rodriguez
uttered a little squeal, the color went from his
face and in a second the plane began to wobble.
Hal pulled him from behind the wheel and
himself righted the ship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep hold of her now,&rdquo; he assured Carmichael
who stood anxiously in the low doorway
of the cockpit. &ldquo;Our brave Ace isn&rsquo;t fit
to steer a baby carriage. He hasn&rsquo;t morale
enough to keep himself going, much less a
ship. All right, now, I&rsquo;m giving you enough
altitude to let you clear us nicely. Can&rsquo;t keep
it up more than a couple of minutes though.
Listen to her missing! Bail out now, Rene,&rdquo;
he added, using the latter&rsquo;s Christian name
unconsciously. &ldquo;See you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sooner than that, Hal,&rdquo; Carmichael smiled
wistfully. &ldquo;Promise me you&rsquo;ll be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doggone right I will! Scoot now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal knew he was going, knew he was gone.
There was that about Carmichael, he felt, that
one immediately missed&mdash;that effulgent something
which seemed to radiate from his slim
person. Now that light had gone with him
and there was no sound but the unsteady throb
of the motor. Rodriguez was huddled over in
the corner of the cockpit shivering, with his
eyes fixed fearfully over the illimitable roof
of the jungle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Hal, however, had ceased to consider his
presence at all. Moreover, there wasn&rsquo;t time.
Every precious second he used in circling
lower and lower over the glistening green
jungle and trying to remember word for word
the valuable advice that the famous brothers
Bellair had given him as to what could be done
in a pinch.</p>
<p>He had cut down a thousand feet, then two
thousand, and then he could pick out the colorful
birds flying from tree to tree. A few hundred
feet more and he could see them quite
plainly. After that he dared to let her dive
a little and coming out on an even keel he saw
something between the dense foliage that made
his heart thump.</p>
<p>It was a clearing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">SAFETY?</span></h2>
<p>Hal shut down the motor after that, let the
plane circle once more under its own momentum,
then pointed her nose straight down toward
the clearing.</p>
<p>Within a flash he had slid from behind the
wheel, reached over in the corner and dragged
Rodriguez by the collar, pulling him into the
cabin with a swift jerk. That accomplished,
he flung himself down to the floor, head down,
and called to the cowardly pilot to do the
same.</p>
<p>Hal tried to keep his mind a blank during
the ensuing seconds. Rodriguez&rsquo; shrieks of
fear, the tearing, ripping sounds of the fabric,
and the shattering of glass did not make
him move a muscle. And when he did stir it
was by force, for the plane thrust her nose
into the swampy ground with such an impact
that he was thrown the length of the cabin
floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>There was another terrific vibration, another
shattering of glass and, before the plane
settled her nose in the mud, Hal and the pilot
were whisked summarily against the cockpit
door. Then all was still.</p>
<p>Hal straightened up as best he could. His
head felt bruised and when he looked at his
hands they were covered with blood. Aghast,
he saw that it came from Rodriguez, who was
lying quite still beside him in a pool of blood.
An ugly gash had severed the fellow&rsquo;s dark
throat&mdash;his lips were gray.</p>
<p>Hal tumbled about in getting out his handkerchief
from his back pocket, for the tail of
the ship was in mid-air, and he was all confused.
But he managed to bandage the pilot&rsquo;s
throat temporarily and set about rubbing his
wrists. At that juncture an ominous smell
floated by with the jungle breeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ship&rsquo;s caught afire, all right,&rdquo; he muttered,
as a small spiral of blue smoke floated
past the shattered window at his elbow.</p>
<p>Hal was out of it in a moment, jumping
down into the soggy ground and pulling the
unconscious Rodriguez after him. A rumble
sounded through the plane and the next second
it was enveloped in high, shooting flames.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Hal stumbled and tripped, sinking into mire
over his ankles. But he managed to drag
Rodriguez&rsquo; heavy, inert body along, dodging
and trampling down bushes, creepers, and
clinging vines that grew in the little spaces
between the tree trunks.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/img002.jpg" alt="HAL MANAGED TO DRAG RODRIGUEZ&rsquo; HEAVY, INERT BODY ALONG." width="500" height="761" />
<p class="pcap">HAL MANAGED TO DRAG RODRIGUEZ&rsquo; HEAVY, INERT BODY ALONG.</p>
</div>
<p>After what seemed an endless journey to
him, he came at last to a sort of eminence, a
tiny area of higher ground that showed evidences
of having been a former human habitation.
The jungle, however, was beginning to
reclaim it, for the whole space was covered
with a substantial growth.</p>
<p>Hal looked about thoughtfully, but seeing
that it was the only suitable spot in sight, he
lay Rodriguez down carefully. After that he
hunted around them for a few sticks of wood
and started a fire to keep away the mosquitoes.</p>
<p>That done, he set about trying to revive the
pilot and after a trying five minutes saw his
eyelids flicker, then open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s I, Rodriguez! <i>Keen!</i> We&rsquo;re here&mdash;<i>safe</i>!
How you feeling?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>The fellow seemed to understand perfectly,
for he nodded and a look of hope came into the
black eyes that were so filled with fear not
fifteen minutes before. Hal noted that his
lips, however, were an ashen gray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saved the plane&mdash;yes?&rdquo; Rodriguez
muttered weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; Hal answered, shaking his head
vigorously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s up in smoke&mdash;fire. We
should worry though, huh? We&rsquo;re saved,
anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodriguez smiled feebly and lifted his head,
looking around, interested. Suddenly he put
his hand to his bandaged throat and a terrified
expression filled his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it danger&mdash;no?&rdquo; he asked Hal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Hal lied. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just got a bad
cut, Rodriguez. You&rsquo;ve lost a lot of blood.
Just lie still and take it easy. I&rsquo;ll get some
more wood to keep these pesky mosquitoes
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The glass she cut me&mdash;no?&rdquo; He seemed
to be obsessed by his wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say she did. That&rsquo;s why I wanted you
to lie face down as I did. I knew we were in
for something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel weak like baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, old fellow,&rdquo; said Hal sincerely.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry we couldn&rsquo;t let you take the chute
and escape all this, but it wouldn&rsquo;t have been
sporting. <i>Understand?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>The pilot nodded weakly. He even smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not frightened for death so much,
Se&ntilde;or Hal. More I was frightened for myself&mdash;my
sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal frowned until his freckled brow
wrinkled into one deep channel between his
bright blue eyes. Then a light of understanding
spread over his fair face and he smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mean your religion, huh, Rodriguez?&rdquo;
he asked. &ldquo;You mean you were afraid
of your sins in case you did die, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodriguez made the sign of the cross and
his dark-skinned hands fell limply to his sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, Se&ntilde;or. My sins were many&mdash;too
many to die a peaceful death, Se&ntilde;or. I
would have to tell you....&rdquo; He closed his
eyes and seemed to doze off.</p>
<p>Hal shrugged his shoulders and got up. He
could hear the burning plane snapping and
cracking against its steel frame. Its acrid
fumes carried on the breeze even to where he
stood and hung heavily on the air in a blue
haze.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>A monkey scolded sharply from a near-by
tree and instinctively Hal picked up a piece
of dead limb and swung it at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see there&rsquo;s a sick boy here who
needs sleep!&rdquo; he stage whispered to the animal
above them.</p>
<p>The monkey stared down with an almost sad
expression on its little old face. Then after
he scolded some more he swung along to the
opposite branch and was soon swallowed up
in the dense foliage.</p>
<p>Hal continued to gather more wood after
that, looking at his patient at five-minute intervals.
But Rodriguez slept on, despite the
fact that a fresh bandage had been adjusted&mdash;the
pilot&rsquo;s own handkerchief.</p>
<p>It was almost dark in the dense forest before
Hal stopped. His pile of wood had become
quite high&mdash;enough to do them for the
long night, he thought, as he sat down on it to
have a smoke.</p>
<p>A parrot screeched somewhere in the distance,
the jungle teemed with life and sound,
and yet it seemed to Hal he had never sat in
such oppressive silence before. Suddenly, to
his great delight, Rodriguez awakened and,
noting the glow of their campfire, smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, it is comfort, the fire,&rdquo; he sighed.
&ldquo;You know the jungle&mdash;no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Hal answered with a cheerful smile.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in Panama&mdash;yes. I know the
jungle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; the pilot sighed weakly and closed
his eyes again.</p>
<p>Hal glanced at him quickly and a fear asserted
itself. Rodriguez&rsquo; throat was still
bleeding profusely&mdash;the fellow&rsquo;s face had a
ghastly look in the firelight.</p>
<p>Did it mean death?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">A VIGIL</span></h2>
<p>The black vault of heaven with its twinkling
stars could be seen in narrow strips
through the entangled tops of closely growing
trees. Hal looked up at it longingly from
time to time and wondered if a searching
party did come flying overhead, whether or
not they would be able to penetrate the dense
screen and see them.</p>
<p>Their campfire, though piled so high,
seemed pitifully inadequate for such a purpose,
and he experienced a sinking sensation
in his stomach when he thought how much less
it could be seen in the daylight. Too, Carmichael
might not be any better off than they.
Parachutes very often failed one. Perhaps
it would have been better if they had all stuck
and taken their chances together. Rodriguez
was in such a bad way.... Hal had long ago
given up trying to stop the bleeding. But he
felt so hopeless about it, so helpless. There
seemed nothing for him to do but sit and wait.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>He leaned over to the woodpile from time
to time, replenishing the blaze. Sometimes
Rodriguez would sigh, then sink into a deeper
sleep than before. Hal was always hoping
that the sleep was doing him good, but it occurred
to him after a time that the pilot&rsquo;s
strength was slowly ebbing and that it wasn&rsquo;t
slumber, but a torpor which held him in its
grip.</p>
<p>His heart went out to the young man and
he completely forgave him his cowardice.
Certainly Rodriguez was getting the worst of
it. Perhaps it was true that he had feared
the consequences of his sins more than his
actual departure from life. Hal shrugged his
shoulders at the thought&mdash;the Latin temperament
was indeed strange.</p>
<p>For a little while after that, Hal began to
think of food and water. He had had neither
since luncheon and, for a healthy young man
with his appetite, that was a fearful length of
time to go without nourishment. But that too
seemed an after consideration in the face of
the present pall that hung over that strange
little jungle camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Hal reached out and taking Rodriguez&rsquo; hand
felt of his pulse. He knew little about such
things, yet enough to realize that the pilot&rsquo;s
pulse beats were anything but normal. At
times he could barely distinguish any pulsation
at all. Moreover, the fellow&rsquo;s hand felt
cold and clammy in his own.</p>
<p>When he went to relinquish his hold, Rodriguez
showed some resistance. He held feebly
to Hal&rsquo;s warm, strong hand and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel not so cold, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he explained
hesitantly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s....&rdquo; he seemed too weak to
say more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it makes you feel better and
warmer for me to hold on to your hands?&rdquo;
Hal asked him solicitously.</p>
<p>Rodriguez nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, fellow. Here, give me the other
one&mdash;I&rsquo;ll rub them, huh? We&rsquo;ll have a little
holding hands party.&rdquo; Hal chuckled, trying
not to see the questioning, poignant look in the
pilot&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>He went to sleep again this way, but Hal
kept hold of both his hands, pressing them with
his own at intervals. It gave him a peculiar
sensation, this maternal gesture on his part,
and if he had not felt so utterly sad about
Rodriguez&rsquo; condition he would have been
abashed at his display of tenderness.</p>
<p>The long hours crept by&mdash;a glimpse of full
moon showed in a single silver moonbeam
through the trees. From the depths beyond
the clearing came the mournful sound of living
things unseen. The weird plaint of the
sloth came drifting down the breeze, tree frogs
and crickets clacked and hummed with a monotony
that was utterly depressing, and once
the air shook with a thunderous concussion
from some falling tree.</p>
<p>Hal started but it did not seem to bother
the airman. He merely moved in his torpor
and muttered unintelligibly. After five minutes
of this he spoke aloud, feebly yet clearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was for the <i>Cause</i>, Se&ntilde;or ... the <i>Cause</i>.
Se&ntilde;or Goncalves he too did it for the <i>Cause</i>.
But ah, how it troubles me, Se&ntilde;or....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What troubles you, Rodriguez?&rdquo; Hal
asked, pressing gently down on his hand.
&ldquo;What are you talking about, fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>The airman seemed not to hear, however,
but went on muttering, sometimes aloud,
sometimes not. Hal came to the conclusion
that he was in a sort of delirium and realized
that he ought to have water for the suffering
fellow. Suddenly he began talking again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Goncalves he came to me and asked
would I take the Se&ntilde;ors, uncle and nephew,
up for the <i>Cause</i> ... for the <i>Cause</i>. I was
to wear the chute&mdash;I was to escape, Se&ntilde;or ...
escape, eh?&rdquo; He laughed feebly, bitterly.
&ldquo;Ah, but I am punished ... punished. It is
I who don&rsquo;t escape, eh? I who would see two
innocent Se&ntilde;ors die for the <i>Cause</i> ...
now....&rdquo;</p>
<p>There sounded then through that dark,
breathless atmosphere a call steeped in wretchedness
and black despair&mdash;the wail of that
lonely owl, known to bushmen as &ldquo;the mother
of the moon.&rdquo; Hal had heard many times
when lost in the jungle of Panama what portent
was in that cry, and he was thinking of it
then when Rodriguez raised his head with effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Se&ntilde;or Hal!&rdquo; he cried in a terrified
whisper. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis &lsquo;the mother of the moon&rsquo; and
evil to me, for I have heard it. Ah,
Se&ntilde;or....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lie back, old fellow,&rdquo; Hal soothed him.
&ldquo;Now there, calm down! I&rsquo;ve heard about Old
Wise Eyes too, but you don&rsquo;t think I believe
it, do you? Back in the good old U. S. we&rsquo;d
call that hokum pure and simple. Nothing to
it. It&rsquo;s just an old owl hooting his blooming
head off because he hasn&rsquo;t the brains to do
anything else. In other words he&rsquo;s yelling
<i>whoopee</i> in Portuguese or Brazilian or whatever
you spiggotty down here. I bet you
haven&rsquo;t understood a word of what I said?
No? Well, I don&rsquo;t blame you exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not much time, Se&ntilde;or. I am weak
... the owl she....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for the love of Pete, Rodriguez, forget
it!&rdquo; Hal said, scolding him gently. &ldquo;It
tires you too much to talk about such hokum.
Lie still and if you can only hold out perhaps
Se&ntilde;or Carmichael will get help to us soon.
He may have got a break and landed near
some settlement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or ... <i>Carmichael</i>?&rdquo; asked the airman
faintly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Hal answered smiling, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the
fellow who went out in the chute&mdash;the fellow
who came up with us. His name&rsquo;s Carmichael.
Oh say, I almost forgot, Rodriguez&mdash;of course
you wouldn&rsquo;t understand&mdash;Carmichael and I
were only fooling you about him being my
uncle. My real uncle couldn&rsquo;t come&mdash;he
backed out at the last minute. I met Carmichael
at the field just before you came along.
Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodriguez did understand&mdash;only too well.
His ghastly face looked more ghastly than
ever. He pressed desperately on Hal&rsquo;s warm
hand and sighed. Suddenly he released his
own right hand and from forehead to breast
devoutly made the sign of the cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Hal,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;I am dying ...
there is something I must tell....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">FOR THE &ldquo;CAUSE&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, Rodriguez, you&rsquo;re just feeling kind of
low down, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Hal soothed him. &ldquo;In
the morning you&rsquo;ll be shipshape, you&rsquo;ll see.
Things are just sort of looking black to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am dying, Se&ntilde;or Hal!&rdquo; Rodriguez repeated.
&ldquo;You must listen or I shall not die
peacefully!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, all right, old top. If it eases you to
tell me something, go ahead. But you&rsquo;ll be
as fit as a top in the morning. From what I
know of Brazil-nuts, they&rsquo;re pretty darn hard
to crack,&rdquo; Hal added facetiously.</p>
<p>The ghost of a smile flickered about Rodriguez&rsquo;
ashen lips but soon he was grave again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am for the <i>Cause</i>,&rdquo; he said faintly; &ldquo;I
pledged my life, my honor for the <i>Cause</i> if
need be, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean the rebels?&rdquo; Hal asked,
taking a moment to replenish the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you call it that, Se&ntilde;or. To us it is the
<i>Cause</i>. We want freedom&mdash;political.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what all you birds say. But go on,
Rodriguez.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Goncalves he is a comrade of mine,
Se&ntilde;or&mdash;a comrade in the <i>Cause</i>. And Se&ntilde;or
Pizella....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha, we&rsquo;re getting somewhere,&rdquo; Hal interposed,
taking a sudden interest. &ldquo;Pizella,
huh, Rodriguez?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Se&ntilde;or. He was given command to
follow your Se&ntilde;or uncle, for you were suspect
to what you call&mdash;thwart?... yes, thwart
General Ceara&rsquo;s plans. The General he expect
big munition shipment and your Se&ntilde;or
uncle he was suspect to perhaps prevent the
guns from coming. So Pizella he was told to
find out if Se&ntilde;or Keen had letter and what it
say about what he was going to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was Pizella who took that letter
from my uncle when we were sleeping, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Se&ntilde;or Hal. And that night when passengers
are in saloon, Pizella he takes letter
to Se&ntilde;or Goncalves&rsquo; cabin and leaves it there
for him to decipher. They work together&mdash;no,
Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope to tell you they do,&rdquo; Hal said
thoughtfully. &ldquo;Just as I suspected from the
beginning, but Unk wouldn&rsquo;t listen to anything
about Goncalves. Yet he must have suspected
something this afternoon ... but go
on, Rodriguez.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Goncalves he find out from letter
that your Se&ntilde;or uncle is on trail of Ceara&rsquo;s
munition shipment&mdash;no? That Se&ntilde;or Goncalves
is ordered by Ceara not to let happen.
He must do anything, everything to prevent&mdash;yes?
Se&ntilde;or Goncalves thinks one way&mdash;to invite
your Se&ntilde;or uncle up in plane with me&mdash;the
plane she is crippled over the jungle and
what happens&mdash;no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Hal answered grimly. &ldquo;I see. It
was all a hoax&mdash;a plot, huh? Only I was the
fly in the ointment. To get Unk to fly, you
people had to get me interested, but it fell out
anyway. Unk has probably found out everything
from the interventor by now&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t
doubt but that they&rsquo;re even suspecting foul
play with me already. But Goncalves, they&rsquo;ll
get him....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, if they can, Se&ntilde;or. But the Se&ntilde;or he
was gone after noon today. He is now with
the General Ceara and they are traveling toward
a safe hiding place in the jungle.&rdquo; Rodriguez
gasped at this juncture and lay still a
long time because of his extremely weakened
condition.</p>
<p>Hal looked at him, sympathizing, yet doubting.
Suddenly he leaned over the Brazilian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why are you telling me all this, Rodriguez?
Isn&rsquo;t it against your famous
<i>Cause</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but yes,&rdquo; answered the airman in such
a whisper that Hal had to listen intently.
&ldquo;But when one is dying ... one&rsquo;s sins
against one&rsquo;s brother man.... Se&ntilde;or Hal,
my religion prompts this. My soul she would
never rest unless I asked your forgiveness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rodriguez, old scout, I still insist you&rsquo;re
not going to die, but if it makes you get
stronger, I&rsquo;ll tell you that I have nothing in
my heart toward you but good will. What
have you done to me? Oh, I know I <i>could</i>
have been cracked up plenty, but the thing is,
I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, not yet. But you are two hundred
miles perhaps from white man, Se&ntilde;or. It is
fever and jungle&mdash;no water, savage Indians
before you get out. Se&ntilde;or Hal, you will die
and I am the cause. I send you to it and it
makes me afraid to die.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bosh, old egg,&rdquo; Hal said with a cheerfulness
that he did not quite feel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a lean
horse for a long race and, as I told you, I&rsquo;ve
been lost in the jungle before. Of course not
quite as serious as this&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t have a lot
of bloodthirsty Indians to take into account.
Still, I can handle that when I come to it.
Where there&rsquo;s a will, huh? But say, let&rsquo;s not
talk of gloomy things&mdash;tell me how you managed
to get that plane crippled just at the crucial
moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A powder, Se&ntilde;or, like sand,&rdquo; he gasped.
&ldquo;She was poured into the oil&mdash;enough to make
her grind up the engine in the hour&mdash;no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it would. Clever trick. A gritty
substance, huh? Enough to completely disrupt
the machinery. Well, it did all right.
<i>And how!</i> And you were supposed to try and
save yourself as best you could with the chute,
huh? Well, I&rsquo;m sorry now we didn&rsquo;t let you
do it. You wouldn&rsquo;t be feeling so rotten now.
Carmichael&rsquo;s the kind that can skim through
things, I&rsquo;m certain. I can&rsquo;t believe he won&rsquo;t
get out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my punishment, Se&ntilde;or, my religion
she slaps back for thinking too much of the
<i>Cause</i> and not enough of human life ...
<i>your life</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;As I told you before, Rodriguez, forget
about me. I&rsquo;m not holding it against you. I&rsquo;m
alive and kicking so far, and if I don&rsquo;t keep it
up, well, then I&rsquo;m not as good a guy as I
thought I was. I&rsquo;ve got brains and the Indians
haven&rsquo;t. Fever and water and ...
well, I haven&rsquo;t got them yet, but if I do, I&rsquo;ll
pull through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if not, Se&ntilde;or Hal, would you curse
Jos&eacute; Rodriguez?&rdquo; asked the airman pathetically.
&ldquo;Would you curse me if the Indians....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely not, old top,&rdquo; Hal assured him.
&ldquo;You thought you were doing right for the
<i>Cause</i>&mdash;doing as you thought was right. Why
should I get peeved at <i>you</i>? Little Hal isn&rsquo;t
that way. Now rest yourself and forget your
worries. You must be tired out after all that
chatter. Close your eyes, old fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not have the need, Se&ntilde;or Hal,&rdquo; came
the response. &ldquo;Things are fading&mdash;even your
face, your bright eyes. I can no longer see
them. They are in a mist.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Hal leaned forward, startled. Rodriguez&rsquo;
hands were becoming colder, more limp, but
he did not think it was so near. He could not
believe it even then ... he had never seen
anything just like it, never witnessed a death
so calm, so apparently without effort.</p>
<p>Rodriguez must have sensed Hal&rsquo;s thoughts,
for he nodded his head feebly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One bleeds to death without pain, Se&ntilde;or
Hal,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Do not worry I am
suffering. The world becomes dimmer but
something else comes in its place&mdash;a light that
is bright and makes me happy. Since you have
say you will not curse Jos&eacute; Rodriguez I see
it clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal could not talk&mdash;he could only grasp
tightly the limp, cold hands in his own. But
Rodriguez seemed to understand, for his
features relaxed, and when the lonely owl
again sent its despairing call through the silent
jungle night, he did not seem to start as
before. His lips barely moved, but Hal
caught the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Death to Thee who hears me,&rsquo; cries &lsquo;the
mother of the moon,&rsquo;&rdquo; he was saying. &ldquo;Death
to me, Se&ntilde;or Hal; death to <i>you</i>! And when it
comes, remember to say a prayer for the departed
soul of Jos&eacute; Rodriguez!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Hal promised, choking back a tremor in his
voice. Suddenly he heard a strange rustle in
the tree opposite, and when he looked up, he
saw a glassy pair of eyes staring down at
them in the firelight. &ldquo;The mother of the
moon&rdquo; had come to pay them a visit.</p>
<p>Hal shivered despite an effort to keep calm.
The owl with its broad face and strange, glassy
eyes looked eerie as it sat perched upon the
swinging limb above them. Then, after what
seemed an interminable time, it flapped its
wings and flew into the blackness beyond.</p>
<p>Hal was suddenly aware then that the
pilot&rsquo;s hands had ceased to return his pressure.
They became colder, limp. A sepulchral silence
seemed to envelop the little camp in that
moment; nothing stirred save the elfin breeze
that whispered in the tree tops.</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; Rodriguez was dead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">ALONE AND WAITING</span></h2>
<p>Hal kept his fire going until the red glare
of dawn forced its light through the jungle
mists. Gradually the awful gloom lifted and
he was able to take stock of his surroundings.
Swamp, trees with creepers and clinging vines
growing in the spaces between, and high overhead,
a flock of <i>urubus</i> (Amazonian vultures)
circled in monotonous precision.</p>
<p>Hal rubbed his heavy-lidded eyes vigorously
and shook his disheveled red hair back into
place as best he could. The drone of the whirling
vultures just evident with the advent of
dawn already annoyed him. What would they
be if help did not come before another premature
twilight had settled over the forest?
He dared not think of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>He could not bring himself to the thought
of a grave for Rodriguez in the jungle. It
seemed to be an admission that there was no
hope for rescue. Yet there were the vultures
waiting, waiting....</p>
<p>Mid-morning came and despite the grim
presence of death, Hal felt savagely hungry
and thirsty. He had been careful about his
cigarettes; there were six left. He selected
one now and though in need of its soothing reaction,
he could not smoke it because of his
empty stomach. And as a gesture of economy
he pinched it out and replaced the stub in the
pack.</p>
<p>After a period of inactivity, he suddenly decided
to leave his gruesome charge for a few
moments and go visit the scene of the wreck,
just for something to do. It made him feel
inexpressibly sad, however, for in viewing it
he saw that two of the surrounding trees had
burned considerably and their charred trunks
were sagging in such a way as to cause the
foliage on the upper limbs to lean toward the
foliage of the adjoining trees and thus screen
off a good part of the clearing from above.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>There was little left of the plane but the
framework, and the crippled motor was all but
buried in the mire. Hal gave it but a hurried
glance and walked back to his little camp,
steeped in despair. He couldn&rsquo;t put down the
thought that Carmichael had not succeeded
and that he need not expect any help from that
source.</p>
<p>He would not give in to those imps of discouragement
within, but bravely kept his eyes
on that chink of sky shining through the trees.
Noon came and was gone, the vultures had increased
in number and Hal saw, with sinking
heart, that they were getting bolder, flying
lower and lower.</p>
<p>He gathered a quantity of dead leaves, all
the foliage that he could find in the immediate
neighborhood, and made a temporary bier for
the dead airman. In lifting him over into it,
he felt something hard and bulging in the back
pocket of his trousers. Hal drew it out and
saw to his joy that it was a thirty-eight calibre
revolver and seemed to be fully loaded.</p>
<p>A further search of the young man&rsquo;s pockets
revealed nothing but some small change and
the usual miscellaneous collection one is apt
to find. Hal sighed with relief when the task
was over and carefully put all his findings
into Rodriguez&rsquo; helmet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>That done, he sat down and made a careful
inspection of the gun. True to his first hope,
there wasn&rsquo;t a chamber discharged and this
discovery gave Hal pause, for it occurred to
him that Rodriguez had had in his possession
a most effectual weapon with which to make
good his intention of bailing out in the parachute.
Why then had he not used it?</p>
<p>Hal came to the conclusion that it must have
been because Rodriguez&rsquo; character was a contradiction.
Though he could participate in a
murderous plot, when it came to carrying it
out, he thought more of the effect that it would
have on his soul, than he did of his beloved
<i>Cause</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a half bad scout at that, poor devil,&rdquo;
Hal summed it up. &ldquo;How do I know what my
behavior would be under a like condition? I
certainly wouldn&rsquo;t see innocent people crash
to their deaths and keep an easy conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal pocketed his gun carefully and rambled
about the neighborhood the remainder of the
afternoon. Just before the gloom crept into
the clearing he bethought himself of all the
fantastic tales he had heard of the bounty of
the Amazon jungle. Most of the stories gave
one the impression that food could be had by
reaching out and plucking it from the fruit-laden
trees. Never, he realized, was a condition
more exaggerated, for the primeval
jungle in which he was lost had little or nothing
to offer in the way of food.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>He had found a few trees which seemed to
offer some promise of allaying his hunger, but
after a few bites of the fruit he was forced to
throw it down in disgust. It was too bitter
for human consumption. Other fruit which
looked more palatable he was afraid to touch,
fearing poisoning might be the result.</p>
<p>And so just as the first shadows of the premature
twilight stalked the jungle, Hal espied
an <i>inambu</i>, or forest fowl, fluttering homeward
for the night. A well-timed shot, however,
intercepted him and he fell straight into
the clearing.</p>
<p>Hal&rsquo;s hopes rose a little after that. He
found, surprisingly, that he could do wonders
with his two bare hands. The fowl was
plucked and given as good a cleaning as was
possible, considering the lack of water. And
if he was a little skeptical as to its sanitary
merits, he did not allow the thought to spoil
the pleasant anticipation of a poultry dinner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>He gathered wood again, piles of it, and
built a fine fire. Darkness had settled before
the meal was cooked, but Hal was indifferent
to everything save his primitive cooking. The
fowl required all his attention and had to be
roasted over the fire by means of a stick which
he had broken at one end into a sort of make-shift
prong.</p>
<p>He consumed the whole bird, and though it
was rather tasteless without salt, he was
thankful for that much. Water he tried not
to think of. Sleep he could have for the taking,
and he set about piling wood onto the fire
so that he could sleep for an hour or two without
fear of having the jungle night prowlers
disturb his much-needed slumber.</p>
<p>The hands of his wrist watch pointed to
eight o&rsquo;clock as he settled himself close to the
fire. The heat was a little uncomfortable, but
he dared not risk sleeping away from its protecting
glow. And as he shut his eyes to the
dismal solitude about him, his prayer was a
hope that tomorrow would bring help.</p>
<p>But Hal was to learn that tomorrow never
comes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">RODRIGUEZ HAS COMPANY</span></h2>
<p>Hal awakened at the witching hour of midnight
to find that he was being deluged in a
rainstorm, his fire was out and he couldn&rsquo;t see
anything but the radium-faced dial of his
wrist watch.</p>
<p>He jumped up and scurried to the shelter
of some near-by trees, shivering in his soaked
clothes. Something moved swiftly near by, he
heard a rustle of leaves and the patter of slow,
velvety footsteps on the soggy ground.</p>
<p>In a second he had delved into his pocket
and brought out his package of matches. But
they were dry and he had one lighted in an instant&mdash;in
time to catch a flashing glimpse of
a jaguar&rsquo;s yellowish-brown spots as it leaped
across Rodriguez&rsquo; temporary bier and disappeared
between the trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Hal shouted to frighten it and his match
burned out. He continued to shout, meanwhile
breathlessly seeking for some of the
drier pieces of wood which he had stored beneath
the trees. The rain stopped then, but
still it took him an interminable time to coax
a flame out of the damp wood. But at last he
succeeded and after he had coaxed the flame
into a fairly generous fire he set about drying
out the rest of the wood.</p>
<p>From time to time he glanced at the telltale
mound in the shadows and each time he
shivered. The jaguar incident brought home
to him the realization that necessity forced
Rodriguez&rsquo; last resting place to be in the
jungle. Decency forbade a recurrence of that
midnight scene and he knew that dawn would
bring again the black scavengers of the air in
increased numbers. Nothing but a quick,
effectual burial would drive them away.</p>
<p>It was the only way out.</p>
<p>Hal spent the remainder of the black hours
drying his clothes. His immaculate flannels
were now a brownish hue, spotted here and
there with mud and wrinkled into a state that
defied even the dry cleaner. And his shoes,
once so trim and smart looking, were not recognizable
because of several layers of clay
which had dried upon them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Just before a new day dawned in the jungle,
Hal groped his way through the dark to the
scene of the wreck. He built a small fire there
to give him light and proceeded to hunt about
the framework for something which could be
used as a spade. But that availed him
nothing, and he was about to give up in despair
when he happened to notice the trench
which the crippled engine had burrowed as it
fell. The propeller, he saw at once, had completely
loosed itself in the impact and was
lying a few feet distant.</p>
<p>Hal pulled it out of the mud and with it a
frightened spider which ran across his hand,
leaving a trail of poison which caused not
only an intense burning but severe inflammation
as well. In point of fact, all of Hal&rsquo;s
jungle trials seemed to begin with that spider&rsquo;s
infection.</p>
<p>He sucked out the poison as best he could
and trudged back to the clearing with the propeller.
Dawn found him using it as a spade
with which to dig a last resting place for Jos&eacute;
Rodriguez, and if it was rather ineffectual as
an instrument, it was none the less fitting that
it should be used in preparing an airman&rsquo;s
grave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>The sun was high in the east when Hal had
pounded the last bit of mire into place.
Solemnly, then, he dug the propeller at its
head and left it there as a marker. For a moment
he stood glancing at his handiwork, feeling
inexpressibly sad and without hope. His
hand caused him much pain; he was weary
from irregular sleep and his thirst knew no
bounds.</p>
<p>The grave seemed to be the final gesture. It
was his admission of lost hope and he voiced
it aloud. Not a bit of use was there to scan
the blue chink of sky. Carmichael was not to
be the means of his rescue, he felt it just as
surely as he felt thirst. What would be the
means of his rescue, if at all, he could not feel.
Indeed, the thought itself seemed to be swallowed
up in the vague mists of the future.</p>
<p>He turned his back on the lonely grave,
wrapped in despair. Nothing mattered much
except that he get a drink of water, somewhere,
somehow. He turned east, thinking
that at least he was facing <i>Manaos</i> and if he
was fortunate enough to keep going in that
direction he would some day reach there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Some day!</i>&rdquo; Hal laughed bitterly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
like tomorrow, I guess&mdash;it never comes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>And as he stepped from the clearing into the
trackless maze of jungle, a beautiful yellow-breasted,
black-coated bird warbled at his back
with an insistence that Hal felt was nothing
but mockery. Its cheerful whistling note he
could not bear. It was decidedly out of place
in that dismal solitude, he thought, as he
turned to view the creature.</p>
<p>But he quickly changed his mind, however,
when he saw that the silver-throated creature
had hopped onto a limb of the tree that
shadowed Rodriguez&rsquo; grave. The bird seemed
to defy all that was sad and with its graceful
head to one side it poured out a medley of
cheer in the trilling call, <i>pir-i-pi-pi, pir-i-pi-pi</i>.
And strangest of all, the beautiful little creature
seemed to be directing its efforts toward
the silent mound beneath it.</p>
<p>Hal turned his back on the clearing for good
and all, then. He could do it now with a heart
less heavy. At least he would not have that
contemptible feeling that he was leaving a fellow
being in the eternal solitude of the jungle.</p>
<p>Rodriguez would never be alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">A DAY AND A NIGHT</span></h2>
<p>Hal groped his way through another jungle
day and just as the shadows began to creep
through the forest he came upon an almost
overgrown trail. He was overjoyed, for it
was the first indication he had seen that something
else besides animal life had trod that
lonely region. Also, he could see in the deepening
gloom that the foliage and trees became
more attenuated from this point on.</p>
<p>Did it mean that he was approaching a settlement?
Civilization? Even in his extreme
joy he dared not hope for that much. But
the anticipation of seeing a human being was
quite enough. That and a drink of cool water
was all he asked for.</p>
<p>His hand hurt him constantly and he found
it difficult to use it at all. Consequently he
went around picking up the wood for his fire
with his left hand, which seemed to take him
considerably longer. And when night closed
in he had only enough to burn for a few hours.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>He decided to make the best of it&mdash;in point
of fact, he felt too utterly weary and feverish
to do otherwise. Just then he was powerless
to do aught but spread out his flannel coat and
lie down. The making of campfires was beginning
to get on his nerves.</p>
<p>But he managed another fire, hoping
against hope that it would be the last. He
piled onto it all the wood that he had gathered,
then lay down on the spread coat and thought
over the day which he had just spent.</p>
<p>He had killed two fowls which meant two
bullets less in his gun. Also he was down to
two cigarettes and the same number of
matches. It was a matter of necessity that he
reach some sort of settlement that next day.
A horrible chill shook him from head to foot,
when he thought of what a time he would have
if another day&rsquo;s tramping brought him no
more than the day just closed.</p>
<p>Finally he got to sleep and tossed for two
hours, dreaming horrible dreams. When he
awakened, the fire was dead and he found himself
besieged with mosquitoes. There was no
brushing them off and even when he used up
his next to the last match to light a cigarette
and smoke them out, he had little or no success.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>The itch and sting of them drove him to distraction,
and after an hour he gave up all
thought of trying to sleep. Then for a long
interval he paced up and down his little clearing
with his coat pulled about his head. After
that proved uncomfortable he decided to grope
his way through the dark and take his chances.
Anything to keep going.</p>
<p>He did.</p>
<p>He hadn&rsquo;t gone but five hundred feet when
he remembered about the trail and its promise
for the morrow. What was getting into him
that he could forget that so soon? Was he
delirious? Certainly he felt he would be if he
couldn&rsquo;t sleep some more somewhere and rest
his feverish, aching body. But the memory of
the trail became very vivid, very promising
then, and he decided not to go one step further.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>And Hal&rsquo;s life rested on that decision, for
he had hesitated upon that step. One foot,
however, had already been plunged forward
and he felt water close over it. In a moment
he had drawn it back, trembling and shaken,
for something had rubbed against it. And in
a nervous abandon he took out his last match,
struck it against the little box and held it up
to see that he had barely escaped certain death.</p>
<p>For the flickering light of the match showed
him to be standing on the brink of a stagnant
jungle pond. And lying on its slimy banks
was a huge alligator blinking curiously at the
tiny flame and occasionally opening its cavernous
jaws.</p>
<p>The light went out, but Hal found his way
back to the camp and he stayed there until
dawning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">WITH THE MORNING</span></h2>
<p>Hal was sick when daylight seeped in
through the trees; he felt much too sick to do
anything but stay right where he was. But
the nearness of the pond housing an alligator,
and the hope that the trail revived, did much
toward giving him the strength and initiative
to go on.</p>
<p>The trail skirted the pond, for which he was
tremendously thankful. He gave it a furtive
glance in passing, but there was nothing save
a good-sized ripple on the slimy-green surface,
and Hal decided that the monster must be taking
his morning bath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he can stay under until I get out of
sight,&rdquo; Hal muttered savagely. &ldquo;One look
at that fellow will last me for a long, long
time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>He trudged along, feeling more and more
encouraged at the decided thinning out of the
jungle. He felt freer, more like breathing
than when back in the dense forest, and the
broad expanse of daylight in the heavens set
his heart to beating faster.</p>
<p>He almost forgot that his body ached and
that his head throbbed terribly. Fever racked
him and his right hand was so swollen that
it was practically useless. But there was always
the trail winding in and out of the trees,
lost one moment in a maze of bushes between
the trees, then coming up again a few feet
further on.</p>
<p>The sun came up in a vast red ball, and Hal
could see its reflection now upon the shining
leaves in the tree tops. He had stopped a
moment to look at it, when he heard a sudden
rustling noise in the distant bushes. He
stepped up, realizing that it sounded like some
heavy object plunging about in the undergrowth,
and was about to withdraw instinctively,
when there arose in the morning air a
blood-curdling roar.</p>
<p>Before he had time to retreat, the bushes
parted and out from them leaped a jaguar.
Its spotted back reared high in the air and,
with an infuriated squall, it came down at
Hal&rsquo;s feet. An arrow sticking out of its thick
neck told the story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Obviously the animal was as much surprised
as Hal, for it backed down a moment, crouching
on its hind legs and swinging its tail with
a great thumping sound each time it switched
on the ground. But not for a moment did it
take its savage eyes from the astonished young
man before it.</p>
<p>Hal saw at once that the animal was suffering
great pain from the arrow, but the wound
was not mortal. Its frequent squalls betokened
anger and revenge against all humanity,
and, from the hard glint in its eyes, this retaliation
would be thorough.</p>
<p>Hal did not stir from the spot, but, with a
stealthy gesture, he reached around to his back
pocket. The next second he had aimed the
gun at a spot right between the jaguar&rsquo;s steely
eyes, but his aim was poor with his left hand
and he knew it. Consequently, the second the
explosion occurred, he was fleeing toward the
nearest tree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Up the slimy trunk he clambered, but not
before the animal reached out and clawed his
right leg. Nevertheless, he hitched himself
up, biting his lips with pain, and settled on
the nearest bough. Meanwhile, the jaguar
was crawling after him, hissing and emitting
blood-curdling cries.</p>
<p>Hal aimed the gun again, this time supporting
it as best he could with his swollen right
hand. The bullet sang, the jaguar screamed,
and before its echo had died away in the tree
tops, it fell with a terrific thud and rolled five
or six feet before its spotted body became
rigid in death.</p>
<p>For a long time, Hal stayed where he was,
fearing that the cat might suddenly revive.
But when ten minutes had passed and there
was no sign of such a miracle, he carefully replaced
the gun in his pocket and undertook to
get down from his uncomfortable retreat.</p>
<p>He soon found that he could not use his leg
at all and had to slide to the ground, blistering
his good hand and feeling faint when he
tried to stand upright. He reached out to
support himself on the tree trunk but a wave
of giddiness passed through his throbbing
head and though he felt himself sinking he
seemed not to be able to prevent it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>He found himself in a heap and seemed to
have neither the strength nor the desire to do
aught but stretch out and lie where he was.
Pain governed him now from head to foot and
he feared for his wounded leg. But the fear
soon gave way to a sort of apathy out of which
he did not rise.</p>
<p>His eyes noted indifferently the sun climbing
higher in the blue heavens. It gleamed
quite strongly through the swaying branches
and, in its glistening light, various-colored
birds flitted about. Suddenly he saw something
black moving with a familiar whirling
motion.</p>
<p>They circled closer and closer to the tree
tops, swaying with each revolution of their
huge black bodies like some small army of the
sky moving earthward as a single unit. There
was a fascination in that continuous circling,
Hal found&mdash;a rather dread fascination, and he
vaguely remembered that the dead jaguar lay
not fifteen feet from him.</p>
<p>Then when their black bodies barely
skimmed the tree tops he bethought himself of
his own physical condition. He knew he was
getting weaker by the moment. Besides his
wounded leg and infected hand, some strange
fever seemed to be consuming him. Suddenly
a horrible thought came to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Did it mean that he was destined to die in
that unholy spot? Did it mean that those
gruesome scavengers of the air were waiting
for that moment to arrive? Something was
holding them off from descending upon the
hapless jaguar&mdash;was it himself?</p>
<p>Hal shivered and shuddered, yet he hadn&rsquo;t
the power to stir his body one inch. He could
only lie there and stare at the black mass moving
nearer and nearer, yet waiting, waiting....
But suddenly they seemed to be rushing
toward him&mdash;either that or he was rushing up
toward them! But no, it was neither&mdash;he himself
was sinking down, down....</p>
<p>Strange cries pierced the air then, cries
that were not uttered by bird or animal or
white man. Strange painted bodies moved in
the brush, moved stealthily but surely, and
black, questioning eyes peered out at the
singular scene of a dead jaguar and a red-haired
white man lying but fifteen feet apart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">A GUEST OF SAVAGES</span></h2>
<p>After a few more minutes&rsquo; observation,
twenty-five naked savages crawled out of the
brush, crept up to Hal&rsquo;s prostrate body and
held a noisy conference. Then they took
turns feeling his feverish brow and the irregular
heart beats pounding beneath his powerful
chest. Suddenly two of the warriors
leaned down, one taking his head and the other
his feet, and in solemn procession they
marched off through the brush, leaving two
of their number to skin the jaguar.</p>
<p>Evening came before Hal was conscious of
anything. When he opened his eyes he could
see the glow of many campfires. A deep gloom
seemed to surround him, but sitting on either
side were two Indian women, old and
wrinkled, watching him with blinking eyes
and tightly drawn lips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>He had a bitter taste in his mouth, an herb-like
taste, but he felt not so feverish. Also,
when he went to raise his right hand he noticed
that it was covered with a sort of claylike substance
and the swelling was almost gone. His
leg, too, felt easier and he saw, as he raised it
into the firelight, that it was covered with the
same substance that was on his hand.</p>
<p>Gradually he could pick out a row of pillars
supporting the roof, and from each of these
pillars he noticed a frail crossbar to the outer
wall. Between each of these bars he saw Indians
sleeping, men, women, and children.
Some slept on skins or leaves and some on the
bare ground. Before each of these groups a
fire burned and Hal decided that each group
was a family with their own distinct hearth-fire
burning before their apartments. Over
all was a vast roof.</p>
<p>It occurred to Hal, then, that he was in an
Indian <i>maloka</i>, one of those vast houses of
thatch which the captain of the boat had told
them housed the entire tribe. He was lying
in one of the apartments at the rear, for the
low, sloping roof he could have touched with
his foot if he had had the strength to raise it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>A medley of snores resounded through the
vast hut and from time to time he saw the
squat figures of warriors replenishing their
fires, murmuring to each other for a moment
or two, then retiring again to their apartments
to sleep.</p>
<p>The Indian women guarding Hal watched
him continuously while he was taking stock
of his surroundings. Neither one spoke, but
he caught a questioning look in the eyes of the
older-looking hag and saw her dart behind
him, bringing up a huge calabash filled with
water.</p>
<p>She held it to his lips and Hal drank it
greedily. It was warm and rather too sweet
tasting but, nevertheless, water. Never in his
life was he so grateful for anything, although
he realized that they must have been feeding
him water on and off through the day, for he
felt not nearly so parched as when he lay under
the tree that morning.</p>
<p>When the calabash was empty he looked up
at the Indian woman and smiled his most
brilliant smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You spiggotty&mdash;no?&rdquo; he asked softly, remembering
how often he got some response
from Panama Indians by means of that address.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>But he might just as well have spoken to a
stone statue, for the woman stared at him with
the same blinking eyes. After a moment she
took the calabash and arose, waddling past the
burning fires toward the front of the <i>maloka</i>.</p>
<p>Hal turned his eyes to the other Indian
woman who was regarding him gravely from
under half-closed lids. He used the same alluring
smile upon her, but his earnest efforts
were all in vain, for she continued to watch
him with the same impassivity as before.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes after that and drowsed
at intervals. In his waking moments he could
feel the presence of his female guardians, but
preferred to keep his eyes closed as long as
they wouldn&rsquo;t speak to him. But on the whole,
silence reigned in the vast <i>maloka</i> and now
and again Hal could hear the night voices from
the jungle.</p>
<p>Goatsuckers repeated their monotonous refrain
by the hour and several times the eerie
plaint of the sloth drifted faintly in on the
breeze. The women dozed occasionally, as
was evidenced by their sonorous breathing, but
the moment Hal opened his eyes they seemed
to awaken instinctively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Then came a long interval when a hush
seemed to have fallen over everything. Hal
knew the women were dozing but he kept his
eyes closed, content to lie quiet and rest. He
knew that curiosity would avail him nothing
where an Indian was concerned. That much
he had learned in Panama.</p>
<p>Consequently, when he heard the muffled
scream of a human voice toward dawn, he did
not stir. But the women were on the alert
immediately, for he could hear them
straighten up and lean over him. He feigned
deep, even breathing, however, but continued
to listen.</p>
<p>Another scream pierced the early morning
darkness, echoing and re&euml;choing about the
<i>maloka</i>. Suddenly the cry, though muffled,
was more intelligible, and Hal was certain that
it sounded like someone trying to call &ldquo;<i>help</i>,&rdquo;
though he could not be sure. It was too muffled,
too distant for him to distinguish anything
definite.</p>
<p>In any event, the cry pierced the air for the
third time, and, though it seemed ghostly and
unhuman, its poignancy was distressing. Then
all was still again, but Hal had been so startled
that he found himself up resting on his elbow
and staring hard at the women.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>The elder of the two women stared back at
Hal, then suddenly she got to her knees and
with her brown, bony hands made a number of
gestures which the young man was at a loss
to fathom. After a few moments of continued
eerie, cowering gestures, he began to
understand what she was trying to explain.</p>
<p>The cries he had just heard were ghostly,
not human.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">CONVALESCENCE</span></h2>
<p>Hal took no stock in that, of course, but,
during the long nights of the week following,
he was more than once inclined to be credulous
in the matter. Not a night passed that
he did not hear the sad cries issuing from
some point beyond the <i>maloka</i>. And though
he questioned both the women and the warriors
who came and stared curiously at him,
none could do more than shrug their shoulders
and make meaningless gestures in answer.</p>
<p>Consequently, he was glad when his strength
returned and enabled him to walk as far as
the door of the <i>maloka</i>. Two young but stalwart
warriors had now taken the place of his
female guardians and on this first day of his
convalescence they hovered about constantly,
and he was at a loss to know whether it was
because of their tender solicitude for his uncertain
gait or whether they considered him a
prisoner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>In any event, he got absolutely no encouragement
from either warrior when he
motioned them to show him where the weird
night cries originated. They simply shrugged
their shoulders and gestured in such a way as
to indicate that the Indian considered the
supernatural to be an evil manifestation and
all evil was to be shunned.</p>
<p>But by and large, Hal got on not so badly
with them. He had learned, after the first
day, a series of gestures which indicated his
wants, his likes, and his dislikes. To be sure,
all the food they gave him, he disliked intensely,
but as he was likely to starve unless
he ate what was given him, he put a good face
upon the matter and took what came as a
rule. Also, he felt eternally grateful to them
for having rescued him from a certain horrible
death and nursed him back toward health.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>Every few hours during the day the medicine
man, a fat, pot-bellied old warrior, had
come and sat at his side droning weird incantations
over his recumbent body and making
all sorts of fantastic gestures. Then he would
proceed to delve into a calabash that he had
brought with him, and bring out a smeary-looking
mixture which he plastered on the
patient&rsquo;s wounded leg and hand. And before
he terminated his visit he would raise another
calabash to Hal&rsquo;s lips, nodding for him to
drink deeply of the bitter, herb-tasting fluid
which it contained.</p>
<div class="img">

<p class="pcap">A FAT MEDICINE MAN MADE ALL SORTS OF FANTASTIC GESTURES OVER HAL.</p>
</div>
<p>Nevertheless, Hal continued to get better
and, whether or not it was because of the medicine
man&rsquo;s mysterious magic, he was quite able
to hobble out of the <i>maloka</i> on the second day
of his convalescence.</p>
<p>It was, of course, quite a gala day in the
little settlement. Men, women, and children
stood about in a staring circle to watch their
guest emerge. All small of stature, they
looked up with awe at Hal&rsquo;s towering physique
and shock of red, curly hair.</p>
<p>He hobbled about the clearing, smiling brilliantly,
though feeling dizzy and weak from
his sickness and long confinement in the
gloomy <i>maloka</i>. Nevertheless, he could not
help smiling, for he felt ridiculous in his soiled
and wrinkled flannels and a ten days&rsquo; growth
of golden beard.</p>
<p>For quite a time the natives continued to
follow him about, but seemed to tire of it toward
afternoon and went back to their various
pursuits. Meanwhile, Hal saw something
that gladdened his heart&mdash;a river, which his
guardians explained, with violent grunts and
gestures, was a little river to the big river, or
in other words, a small tributary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>The larger of the two Indians (his head just
reached Hal&rsquo;s elbow), whom Hal dubbed &ldquo;Big
Boy,&rdquo; motioned to a canoe pulled up on the
bank. After a series of gestures which represented
a man paddling down the river, he
looked straight up at the tall young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that canoe is for me?&rdquo; Hal motioned
the question. &ldquo;For <i>me</i> to go back?&rdquo; he
added, pointing to himself and then to the
river.</p>
<p>Big Boy nodded assent.</p>
<p>Hal partook of the evening meal with a
little more relish than he ordinarily would.
He sat with the tribe outside the <i>maloka</i> mincing
on the unpalatable <i>beiju</i> pancakes, which
were a distinctly Indian concoction, and thinking
of the day near at hand when he could turn
his face toward <i>Manaos</i>. He nibbled on the
<i>pimenta</i>, with which <i>beiju</i> is always eaten, and
forgot that it usually burned his civilized
throat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>All his thoughts were on his uncle and how
overjoyed he would be to know that he was
alive and well, after he had been given up for
lost. For certainly he must be thought lost
and dead. Even his mother must think it by
now. His mother....</p>
<p>Hal got up from the communal supper circle
to be alone with the thought of his mother.
The rest of the natives, busy appeasing their
hunger, seemed not to notice him hobbling
away toward the surrounding jungle, particularly
his guards.</p>
<p>Hal did not seem to notice this relaxation
of their guardianship. In point of fact, he
thought nothing at all about it, so filled were
his thoughts of the day on which he could get
word to his mother that all was well with him.</p>
<p>He found the dimness of the jungle trail
inviting and hobbled along deep in his own reflections.
Tomorrow or the next day he would
be well enough to start his journey, he felt
sure of it. And he would leave the little settlement
with a heart full of gratitude. Indeed,
he had already tendered to the chief of
the tribe his empty gun as a token of deep appreciation,
and with much bowing and grunting,
the gift was received in good spirit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>There was nothing to mar his joy then, so
much did he appreciate recovering from the
fever. He stopped, stretched his long arms
delightedly and happened to notice through
the trees a small thatched hut. Before it,
stretched out on the ground asleep, was one of
the natives.</p>
<p>Several monkeys disported themselves on
the branches of the tree over the hut and were
about to pelt the sleeping native with some
nuts. Hal tried to frighten them off by waving
his long arms but they paid no heed. Instead
they set up a chatter and let go a rain of
the hard nuts which fortunately missed their
intended victim and hit Hal instead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; Hal cried as several of the nuts
hit his tender head. &ldquo;For the love of Mike!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words had barely been uttered when
out of the gloomy hut came a heart-rending
cry, muffled and unintelligible, yet full of
poignancy and human wretchedness. Hal did
not miss its pleading note&mdash;in point of fact,
the utter misery of it seemed to make him
powerless to do aught but wonder.</p>
<p>What was it?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">A PRISONER</span></h2>
<p>Hal had not time to consider this at all, for
in a moment, it seemed, the natives had
swarmed up from the clearing and surrounded
him. And the native lying before the hut had
gotten to his feet in an amazingly short time,
producing a bow and arrow and looking as if
he would use it on the slightest pretext.</p>
<p>Hal&rsquo;s pet guardian, Big Boy, stepped up to
his side at this juncture and pulling him by
the arm urged him back toward the clearing.
He did so, willing but puzzled, and as he
turned his back toward the hut, the same cry
of misery broke out, pleading and utterly
pathetic.</p>
<p>Hal stopped, hesitated, as if he were going
to go back, when he noticed that a number of
the warriors were following him with bows
and arrows drawn. Big Boy, too, marching at
his side, had acquired an exceedingly pugnacious
expression on his usually bland countenance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Straight back to the <i>maloka</i> they marched
him, saw him safely to his apartment in the
rear, then left Big Boy standing guard while
they gathered in the front for a long and noisy
conference.</p>
<p>Hal could make nothing out of the whole
proceedings. He did not know what it was all
about. Yet the uneasy thought recurred that
it was not a promising sign to see naked savages
following him about with drawn bows and
arrows. They had not done so before. What
did it mean now?</p>
<p>Had his presence before that strange hut incurred
their enmity? And if so&mdash;why? Why
should that wretched cry bring them swarming
to his side and cause them to treat him as
if he had committed some crime? Why?</p>
<p>Hal was to learn why, to his sorrow, and
that the way of the Amazon Indian is indeed
very strange.</p>
<p>In the meantime he was doing all in his
power to get Big Boy in a spirit of good will.
He coaxed and cajoled to find out why he was
being guarded thus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>Big Boy, ever an admirer of Hal&rsquo;s powerful
physique and commanding grace, relaxed a
little to motion that the warriors of the tribe
were holding a pow-wow to ascertain what
should be done about the incident before
the hut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about it?&rdquo; Hal gestured with one of
his sad-sweet smiles. &ldquo;I have done nothing.&rdquo;
He shrugged his shoulders and put his hands
over his heart to show that he was innocent of
any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Big Boy melted enough to wriggle his hands
in a way that conveyed to Hal the information
that the spirits were offended. His going
along the trail to the hut and hearing those
cries made him a thing of evil. And to the Indian,
evil was a thing to be shunned.</p>
<p>Through Big Boy&rsquo;s lucid mode of expression,
Hal learned that a demented native occupied
that hut, or rather he was incarcerated
there as evidenced by the native guarding it.
And a demented person, Big Boy explained
by pounding his head vigorously, was unholy,
evil. Thus the person upon whom this evil
one cries also becomes evil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so all you guys think I&rsquo;m evil, huh?&rdquo;
Hal asked, gesticulating wildly and pounding
his broad chest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>Big Boy nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can they do about it?&rdquo; Hal persisted,
feeling not a little uneasy.</p>
<p>Big Boy shrugged his shoulders in answer
and Hal could get nothing more out of him for
quite a while. He went to sleep and slept for
an hour. When he awakened, he saw that his
wrist watch was being curiously inspected by
the Indian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like?&rdquo; Hal motioned, sitting up.</p>
<p>Big Boy nodded, then, with a grave shake of
the head, sat down alongside of Hal.</p>
<p>The tribe, Hal noticed, were all settled for
the night in their apartments. No one but him
and the Indian were awake at that moment.
One could have heard the proverbial pin drop
when Big Boy suddenly motioned to his bow
and arrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>For the next five minutes he enacted with
pantomimical accuracy just what was going
to take place in the settlement at dawn. He
pointed first in the direction of the jungle hut,
then he pointed toward the chief who was
lying a few apartments distant, sound asleep.
Big Boy mimicked that powerful personage
by making a grave face and shaking a sagacious
finger at Hal. Next he silently waved
his arms, indicating all the sleeping warriors
in the <i>maloka</i>, then pointed toward the heavens
as a final gesture.</p>
<p>Hal comprehended it all, and he almost
wished that he hadn&rsquo;t, for it wasn&rsquo;t terribly
comforting news.</p>
<p>For his stroll through the jungle trail and
the evil that the warriors believed had been
visited upon the tribe through Hal, the
sagacious chief had pronounced sentence on
their white guest. That sentence condemned
Hal to death at dawn&mdash;death by bow and arrow
at the hands of the tribe&rsquo;s picked warriors.</p>
<p>Hal shivered and glanced at his young captor
a moment. The young man must have
some liking for him, else why did he tell him
all this? Could he use Big Boy&rsquo;s liking and
hero worship to his own advantage?</p>
<p>He tried, using all the wit and cunning that
he could muster. Smiles, pleading looks, and
even a cajoling shake of his captor&rsquo;s shining
shoulder which Hal followed up by thrusting
his wrist watch under Big Boy&rsquo;s nose. And
that did the trick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>The Indian nodded his head, pleased, and
sat as still as a mouse while Hal fastened the
watch on his left wrist. When it was adjusted
he indulged in a smile, moving his hand back
and forth to see the glow of the radium-faced
dial in the gloom of the <i>maloka</i>. He was like
a child with a toy.</p>
<p>Hal waited long enough for him to enjoy it,
then nudged him warningly. Time was fleeting,
the fires were burning and every warrior
was deep in sleep. From past observation he
knew that such utter silence did not long reign
in the <i>maloka</i>. He would have to act and act
quickly.</p>
<p>Big Boy rose and motioned his captive to
follow stealthily. Hal followed obediently,
but never in his life did he seem to make more
noise. The warriors, however, did not hear it,
for no one stirred throughout the length of
the <i>maloka</i>. Then they reached the door.</p>
<p>A full moon was coming up and Big Boy
motioned Hal to walk close to the trees. He
walked out in full view of the clearing, however,
his dark shining body glistening with
every stride. At intervals he stopped, listened
intently, then pattered on toward the
river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>They came out on the banks without incident,
in the full light of the moon. The
canoe was there&mdash;the canoe which the chief
had decided was not to take the white young
man back to civilization. But Big Boy had
decided otherwise, and he motioned Hal to
hurry, pushing the frail-looking craft well out
into the stream.</p>
<p>Hal got in without a word or a sound. He
turned, putting out his hand in gratitude to
the young Indian lad who was saving his life,
but was surprised to see that Big Boy had also
clambered in the canoe and had taken up one
of the paddles preparatory to departure.</p>
<p>He only nodded to Hal&rsquo;s inquiring look and
with a few rapid strokes put considerable
distance between themselves and the settlement.
Then he held up his hand on which the
wrist watch was fastened, and shook his head
darkly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Hal understood and it made him feel mean.
But Big Boy would not have it so. He smiled
reassuringly to his white friend as if to tell
him that it did not matter. He may have
earned the eternal condemnation of the spirits
and of his people by helping the evil-stricken
white man to escape, but had he not gained a
wrist watch and a friend? That was the gist
of his violent gestures.</p>
<p>Hal shrugged his shoulders, but he was
touched by Big Boy&rsquo;s devotion. Truly, the
way of the Amazon Indian was strange.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small">THE PASSING OF BIG BOY</span></h2>
<p>Hal helped Big Boy paddle for two hours,
but he was so completely exhausted at the end
of that period that he had to stretch himself
out in the bottom of the craft. The Indian
nodded understandingly and pointed to his
white friend&rsquo;s head as if to say that he knew
all along what toll the fever had taken of his
strength. Very wisely he had reckoned that
his tall friend could not stand the strain of
the journey alone.</p>
<p>Hal put out his hand and gave the Indian
an affectionate slap. His gratitude knew no
bounds, for he realized more than ever that
Big Boy&rsquo;s decision to come with him had been
actuated by a high and noble motive, the desire
to help a fellow being weakened by fever.
And no one knew better than the Indian how
weak his friend would be.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>Hal was so deeply affected by this realization
that he determined never to let Big Boy
out of his sight, never in his life. And during
the long night hours, though there was not a
word spoken, nor a hand moved in gesture,
they found a mutual contentment in each
other&rsquo;s company.</p>
<p>The moon slipped down behind the clouds
after midnight and they paddled through the
remaining dark hours. At dawn they came to
a deserted settlement and agreed to get something
to eat before going further. Big Boy
motioned that the rest of the journey was going
to be strenuous and that they needed all
the nourishment they could get.</p>
<p>He proved himself to be ingenious in the
matter of catching fish with his bow and arrow.
And Hal watched him with something
like awe when he got a fire out of two sticks
just by rubbing them together for an amazingly
short time.</p>
<p>Big Boy did the honors of cooking the fish
also, and Hal had nothing to do but sit down
and help him eat them when they were finished
broiling. Needless to say he did justice to the
Indian&rsquo;s culinary accomplishments.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>Hal noticed, however, that Big Boy&rsquo;s appetite
could top his own by a pretty wide margin.
In point of fact, he seemed to stuff, rather than
eat, and washed down the whole with tremendous
draughts of river water. However, he
seemed contented and not at all distressed by
any thoughts of indigestion, and greeted his
white friend&rsquo;s questioning look with a merry
shake of his flat, black head.</p>
<p>After setting out again they paddled but a
half hour when they came to a waterfall and
were confronted with the necessity of portage.
For two hours they struggled through the
jungle with the canoe and came at last to a
stretch of smooth water.</p>
<p>But their good fortune was not lasting, for
a half hour found them confronting a series
of rapids. Hal insisted upon doing his share
and took up a paddle, protesting that the
breakfast of fish had given him all the strength
he needed for the task.</p>
<p>They raced through the first without incident,
but before attempting the second, a
dangerous looking one, they held a sort of
pow-wow. Hal was decidedly against it, but
Big Boy, by means of guttural grunts and
sounds, assured him that the thing could be
accomplished with careful paddling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Consequently, they set out and, from the
very first, experienced hectic moments. For
a few hundred yards the rocky cliffs compressed
the river-channel to a narrow gorge.
Through this the water angrily forced its way,
venting its fury by sending up foaming spray
and high, lashing waves.</p>
<p>Big Boy motioned Hal at this juncture that
he would do the paddling alone, and as if on
second thought he removed the wrist watch
and gave it to his friend. With a grin he motioned
toward the spray foaming in the gorge
and shook his black head vociferously as if to
say that he was loath to get the watch wet.</p>
<p>Hal laughed and put it in his pocket for
safe-keeping. The next second they were
headed for the gorge, shooting through it with
lightning speed. But halfway through, a
wave struck the frail craft, water poured in,
and before they were able to bail it out, another
wave caught them and turned them completely
over.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/img004.jpg" alt="HAL AND BIG BOY WERE THROWN OUT OF THE CANOE." width="500" height="746" />
<p class="pcap">HAL AND BIG BOY WERE THROWN OUT OF THE CANOE.</p>
</div>
<p>Hal came up under the overturned canoe
and rapidly swam from under. Once on the
surface he looked about and saw that the Indian
had been carried quite a little distance
downstream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Hal called vociferously and swam rapidly,
but the nearer he got the stronger was the conviction
that Big Boy was not as he should be.
He seemed to be floundering about in the current
and, as the motion of the water swirled
him about, it was quite obvious from his expression
that he was unable to swim.</p>
<p>Cramps! Hal guessed it in a moment when
he saw the Indian&rsquo;s pale lips and pain-contorted
face. He was paying the penalty for a
huge breakfast.</p>
<p>Hal called to him, motioned to him to hold
on, but the Indian looked to be sinking. Too,
he was in the very heart of the current which
was gradually bearing him down to the torrent
below. By this time, however, his would-be
rescuer was rapidly approaching the spot,
endangering his own life in the attempt.</p>
<p>Two waves in succession caught the Indian
at this point and, just as Hal stretched out to
grasp him, he was carried out of reach and
plunged into a whirlpool. Conscious that
there was no further hope, he lifted his black
head in smiling resignation, then was churned
out of sight by the roaring force of the water.</p>
<p>Hal cried out in despair, but just at that
moment the floating canoe came past and he
reached out and grasped it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br /><span class="small">A JUNGLE VISION</span></h2>
<p>By sheer determination, Hal forced the
stubborn craft back into position and, paddling
with his bare hands, he managed to
emerge safely at the other end. Once there,
he had no heart to go further and pulled into
the bank to rest and reflect upon the Indian&rsquo;s
sad passing.</p>
<p>It was the saddest experience of his life, he
thought as he clambered up on the bank and
sat down. Sadder even than Rodriguez&rsquo;
death, for the Brazilian was but an acquaintance,
while the Indian had proved himself
the best friend a fellow could have. And what
was worse, he felt that he himself was responsible,
for the young man would never
have come to such grief if he hadn&rsquo;t left his
people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>After an hour of these vain regrets he hobbled
down just below the rapids, but there was
no sign of the Indian&rsquo;s body. Watch as he
did, he saw nothing but the foaming spray as
it roared down the rapids. Big Boy&rsquo;s brave,
faithful countenance Hal never saw again&mdash;not
even in death.</p>
<p>He limped on downstream, despondent and
irresolute. The canoe was no good to him
without a paddle, the Indian was gone....
Fate, he decided, was taking an awful whack
at him and he resented it. He had planned
so much to repay Big Boy&mdash;he had even
painted mind pictures of taking him home to
his mother in Ramapo, N. Y. There in the
shadow of the undulating hills he would have
looked quite picturesque. But now it could
never be, and the sad part of it was that he
had not been given the slightest chance to show
Big Boy his deep gratitude.</p>
<p>Suddenly Hal thought of the watch and he
took it out of his pocket, looked at it a moment,
then put it back on his own wrist with
a wistful smile. It had been a queer give and
take between them, yet he was glad that it
had been so. Until the longest day he lived,
he would always think of the watch as a farewell
token of the Indian&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>A macaw, gorgeously plumed, flew over his
head, and further down along the bank he
noticed that the jungle thinned out. That always
meant a clearing, so he hesitated for a
time, drawing back under the trees and listening.
He would not, he determined, walk into
any cannibal camps with his eyes closed.</p>
<p>He listened for fully five minutes and then
suddenly noticed something golden flitting in
and out of the trees below. Emboldened, he
hurried on until he saw that it was not a mirage,
but a real white girl with a crown of
lovely golden hair who was running along the
bank.</p>
<p>Hal&rsquo;s heart seemed to come up in his mouth
then. He wanted to call right away, but he
seemed powerless to do aught but stand and
stare at her slim figure swaying along under
her flowing, old-fashioned skirt. And when
she turned to look out over the river, he
noticed that her feet were quite small, despite
the clumsy canvas shoes she wore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>He thought of his own appearance then,
bedraggled and unkempt. And though his
ruined sport shoes were unsightly indeed, he
felt really more conscious of his terrible
growth of beard. Not being able to see himself,
he visualized his appearance as being
nothing short of disgraceful. Certainly, he
was not fit to show himself before such a vision
as that girl was who was standing on the
bank.</p>
<p>And so in disgust, Hal was about to hide
himself until she had gone, but he was just
too late. She caught sight of him, hesitated
with wonder, then started toward him on
a run.</p>
<p>With a graceful bow, Hal hurried toward
her, also, and steeled himself for the worst under
a critical, feminine eye. But he was destined
to be surprised, for she seemed not to
notice any deficiency in his attire. Indeed,
her first observation was quite unexpected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>A white man</i>&mdash;my goodness!&rdquo; she exclaimed
in a voice that was husky, yet not
harsh. &ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I was going to say,&rdquo; Hal returned,
blushing consciously under his beard.
&ldquo;A white girl&mdash;my goodness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both laughed, then she cupped her
tanned face in her right hand and searched
Hal&rsquo;s face eagerly. He noted at once that
her eyes were gray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been hurt&mdash;sick&mdash;lost?&rdquo; she asked
solicitously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;All three,&rdquo; Hal admitted with a chuckle.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;ve been, where I am,
or where I&rsquo;m headed for, but I do know that
it&rsquo;s darn sweet music to see a white girl in this
wilderness and hear her talking the English
language. <i>Gosh!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed, huskily sweet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not by any chance that person
whom all the Amazon is being searched for&mdash;Hallett
Keen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I know the reason they haven&rsquo;t found
me,&rdquo; Hal laughed. &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re searching for
me with that name to go by, I wouldn&rsquo;t care
if I was ever rescued.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are <i>he</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Hallett&mdash;<i>Hal</i>! Hal Keen is the only
name my dog knows, and what&rsquo;s good enough
for my dog is good enough for me. So I&rsquo;m
Hal Keen, by your leave, young lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so happy to meet you, Hal Keen,&rdquo;
she said laughing, but none the less sincere.
&ldquo;I really am. Particularly am I glad to know
you&rsquo;re alive. Word came through here four
days ago that we were to watch out for a
young man of your description, and here you
are! Think of it!&rdquo; Then, solicitously:
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pale and shaken looking, Mr. Hal&mdash;why,
you&rsquo;re not well!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better than I&rsquo;ve been in a week,&rdquo; Hal assured
her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been through an awful lot,&rdquo;
he said, telling her the story of Big Boy.</p>
<p>She listened attentively while he talked, and,
when he had finished, regarded him gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve an idea you&rsquo;ve been through a great
deal more than even that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some,&rdquo; Hal smiled winningly. &ldquo;But
there&rsquo;s plenty of time to talk about my adventures&mdash;it&rsquo;ll
take me too long now. What I
want to know is who you are and why, where
are we, and why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would take too long to tell you why,&rdquo;
she laughed with gentle mockery, &ldquo;but I can
tell you where we are, first. We&rsquo;re on the
banks of the <i>Pallida Mors</i>, known as <i>River of
Pale Death</i>, also <i>Death River</i>. It was so called
by an Italian scientist who lost his party in
the rapids just about where your Indian boy
was lost. And as for me, I&rsquo;m just Felice
Pemberton and I live....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you say <i>just</i>?&rdquo; Hal interrupted her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII
<br /><span class="small">FELICE AND HAL</span></h2>
<p>Instinctively they sat down together on
the bank. Hal, though weary, was not hungry
nor suffering pain of any kind, and if he had
been, he secretly thought that just talking to
the flower-like Felice would drive it away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard about you&mdash;in fact, I heard about
your whole family,&rdquo; Hal told her. &ldquo;My uncle
and I listened to the story from the captain
on the boat to <i>Manaos</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a cheerful story, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; she
said wistfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I made up my mind right then
and there to pay you people a visit,&rdquo; Hal said
impulsively. &ldquo;Funny, how I wanted to do
that right away when I heard what hard luck
you folks have had. But I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d
bust in this way&mdash;gosh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her gray eyes twinkled as she regarded him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to have you too, Mr. Hal,&rdquo; she
said earnestly, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sorry you had to go
through so much to get here. Grandfather
will send one of the Indians down to let your
uncle know you&rsquo;re safe. But just as soon as
you rest, we&rsquo;ll walk down and get you into a
hammock where you can sleep and recuperate.
We don&rsquo;t have beds up here,&rdquo; she added with
a note of apology; &ldquo;we live very simply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, a hammock will feel like a feather bed
after what I&rsquo;ve been sleeping on,&rdquo; Hal assured
her breezily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the <i>Pallida</i> Indians captured you?&rdquo; she
inquired, interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That what they&rsquo;re called?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By us,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re a sort of
mixture. <i>Pallida</i> identifies them sufficiently.
They&rsquo;re terribly warlike and superstitious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they were kind enough to me at the
go-off. I was in pretty bad shape when they
found me&mdash;they nursed me back. That is, a
fat old medicine man did, and from the way
I got well, I guess he&rsquo;s not all fake. But then
they were willing to shoot poisoned arrows
into me after going to all the trouble of making
me well. If you savvy that, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed, and got him to tell her the
story at the Indian settlement right from the
beginning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know about their superstition,&rdquo; she told
him when he had finished, &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t think
they&rsquo;d go to such an extreme as they tried
with you. I&rsquo;ve heard about the demented
native, though. They keep him imprisoned
in that hut in the jungle and none of the tribe
will go toward it, face forward. They back
toward it in order to keep the evil spirit from
afflicting them. It does seem awful and odd,
but it&rsquo;s their native and their business, and
nobody interferes. They never bother us,
never in all these years. And they wouldn&rsquo;t
bother to come after you; don&rsquo;t worry. Particularly,
because one of their number came
away with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor fellow,&rdquo; Hal said thoughtfully. &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t have had it happen for the world.
He deserved a better fate, believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that is the way with those we
love,&rdquo; said Felice with a poignancy that did
not escape Hal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said sympathetically. &ldquo;I
heard about your father from the captain,
too. It was included in the story. What a
tough break for him, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not only for him, but for all of us. You
see, he had finally come to the conclusion that
he was on the verge of a big discovery. He
had kept it quiet, being afraid that it would
prove disappointing. Consequently, we have
never been able to find out just where the lode
was. That it contained some gold was proven
by the dust he brought home. The last trip
he made was to decide just how much metal
the lode would yield and if it would be worth
while to go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was up this river&mdash;the <i>Pallida
Mors</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Felice answered wistfully, &ldquo;our
river of pale death. We were to leave this
wilderness and live in civilization if Father&rsquo;s
expectations were realized. I went to school
in Rio; we thought of going there to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how a girl like you must like to live in
Rio,&rdquo; Hal said, looking around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we have neither the money, nor the
heart. You heard, I suppose, that none of us
shall leave here for good until Father&rsquo;s body
is recovered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But that&rsquo;s making things awfully
hard for yourselves, isn&rsquo;t it? In a river where
there&rsquo;s rapids....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said with a sigh. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve discussed
that times without number. But we
always come to the conclusion that Father was
seized with one of those uncanny premonitions
that should be given serious thought. He had
a fear that something was going to happen to
him and he had a fear that his dead body
would be left unprotected, something ...
we&rsquo;ve not been able to guess why he had that
fear. In any event, we&rsquo;ve waited ten years&mdash;we&rsquo;re
too poor to do other than stay where we
are and we&rsquo;re conscience free that we haven&rsquo;t
gone away from the region where Father died,
leaving him alone. Even though we haven&rsquo;t
found him we feel better about it than if we
had gone away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you do,&rdquo; Hal agreed thoughtfully.
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s tough on you, Miss Felice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s face lighted up with a radiant
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; she said cheerfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
Grandfather to look after right now and just
when I was beginning to worry, along you
came. And there&rsquo;s a lot of you to come along,
Mr. Hal,&rdquo; she added slyly. &ldquo;When I first
spied you, I was inclined to think it was a
jaguar moving in the bushes; you backed away
so, I was startled. The brownish color of your
suit and the flash of your hair in the sunlight
seemed terribly like the creature until I saw
your vast height popping out of the bushes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, a jaguar wouldn&rsquo;t be so bold as to
come out on the river bank, right in the daylight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we are to believe the story the <i>Pallidas</i>
circulated, the jaguar runs and cries at unexpected
times. Especially the jaguar in whom
they believe my father has been reincarnated.
They say he runs up and down these river
banks trying to lead us to his body and that
he has been caught beneath one of the rapids.
Of course, it&rsquo;s absurd, but I am always startled
when I hear the cry of a jaguar or see one flash
through the brush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They know about how you&rsquo;re waiting to
get your father&rsquo;s body then, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Indians have a way of gossiping
among themselves, the same as the white
men. And as they&rsquo;re so terribly superstitious
I suppose it pleased their fancy to make up
the jaguar story out of that ghostly cry that
sounds up in their region at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this fabled jaguar is supposed to have
a human voice, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, how do you know, Mr. Hal?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;I heard it myself. It&rsquo;s queer, darn
queer....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what my brother Rene has said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Rene?</i> Gosh, I&rsquo;ll always like that name
on account of a swell fellow I met. His last
name was Carmichael.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd, Mr. Hal. My brother&rsquo;s middle
name is Carmichael.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be darned. That&rsquo;s not too odd
to be a coincidence, Miss Felice. Let&rsquo;s get together
on this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><span class="small">SOME TALK</span></h2>
<p>Hal acquainted Felice Pemberton with the
facts of his acquaintance with the spies, Goncalves
and Pizella. Then he launched onto
the topic of his meeting with Rene Carmichael,
and told her in detail all that had transpired
up to the point where they had said
farewell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fits my brother,&rdquo; said the girl worriedly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>got</i> to be him, for who else is
blond and gray-eyed with that name in this
desolate region? And if he said he would get
help to you, you may be certain he would have
done so if it was humanly possible. But we
haven&rsquo;t seen him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then aren&rsquo;t you worried about him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; the girl replied cheerfully.
&ldquo;You see he is something of an adventurer
like yourself. Only he roams about Brazil
picking up odd jobs here and there to support
Grandfather and myself. We don&rsquo;t hear
from him for intervals. What worries me is
that he didn&rsquo;t get help for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let that be the least of your troubles,&rdquo;
Hal assured her. &ldquo;Perhaps he did. Anyway,
I&rsquo;m safe&mdash;and how!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled and got to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now to let Grandfather meet you,&rdquo; she
said quietly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll like you because of your
liking for Rene, but I can&rsquo;t say he&rsquo;ll be terribly
courteous. You see, he&rsquo;s not outgrown
the bitterness my great-grandfather brought
down here from the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Hal, following her
along the narrow trail. &ldquo;That was your great-grandfather,
Marcellus Pemberton, huh?
Well, he wasn&rsquo;t to be blamed for feeling bitter.
Pride. But your grandfather Marcellus; he
shouldn&rsquo;t....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All he knows about Yankees he learned
from great-grandfather Marcellus,&rdquo; Felice
said whimsically, &ldquo;and that wasn&rsquo;t very complimentary
from all accounts. So he&rsquo;s not to
be judged on his merits or demerits.&rdquo; She
laughed. &ldquo;Rene and I are long enough out of
that generation not to care what the Yankees
did. So was my father. He was all for going
back to the United States&mdash;to Virginia.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, you people originally hail
from Virginia, huh? Well, it&rsquo;s a lovely state.
You wouldn&rsquo;t go wrong in going back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; she asked wistfully and
seemed to consider it. &ldquo;What is the U. S.
like, Mr. Hal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kind of a place that you criticize when
at home, but miss it like the dickens when you
go away. Anyway, she&rsquo;s not so bad as countries
go, Miss Felice. It&rsquo;s fine for girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Girls!</i>&rdquo; she repeated softly. &ldquo;It must be
fine. Rio is nice, but no doubt Virginia is
nicer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And safer,&rdquo; said Hal, looking about the
lonely place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you could only tell Grandfather that as
convincingly as you&rsquo;ve told me,&rdquo; she sighed.</p>
<p>She glanced up at Hal and he noticed that,
despite her tanned face, there was a pinched
look about her that indicated uncertain health.
And he wondered that she had any health at
all for having lived all her young life in that
jungle wilderness.</p>
<p>Felice Pemberton, Hal decided, was meant
to live in the United States and nowhere else.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><span class="small">OLD MARCELLUS</span></h2>
<p>Marcellus Pemberton, the third, greeted
Hal courteously, yet coldly. White-haired
and rugged, he welcomed his guest with all the
pompous grace of the old southern aristocracy.
He promised to dispatch an Indian toward
<i>Manaos</i> at once, then sniffing airily asked
what part of &ldquo;Yankee-land&rdquo; the stranger had
come from.</p>
<p>Hal took it in good part and smiled. There
wasn&rsquo;t a Yankee-land any longer, he informed
the old man. The United States was one; all
those abiding there were Americans. Yankee
was an almost obsolete word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the spirit of the Old South,&rdquo; said
Old Marcellus defiantly. &ldquo;We of the jungle
are free men and not to be driven out of our
homes by those who do not agree with our
political and personal views. We can stay
here until we die&mdash;we have our Indian servants....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;Slaves?&rdquo; Hal interposed, looking about at
the ragged-looking Indians moving in and out
of their miserable thatched huts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An ageless and honorable custom if one
treats one&rsquo;s slaves like human beings,&rdquo; said
the old man coldly. &ldquo;I treat mine as best I
can after all these years of poverty. Misfortune
and hardship can come to any man, even
to the free man of the jungle.&rdquo; He said this
last as if to reassure himself that he believed
what he had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Misfortune comes to all of us at some time
or other, Mr. Pemberton,&rdquo; Hal said politely.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a touch of it myself, and I&rsquo;m feeling
rather low down just now. By your leave,
I&rsquo;ll rest until the old vim and vigor come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Marcellus was the soul of hospitality
despite his prejudices. To slight a guest on
his property was the last thing in the world
he would care to do, whether that guest was a
hated Yankee or no. And, with Hal&rsquo;s admission
of indisposition, all his innate courtesy
came to the fore. He poured out apologies
profusely, and bade his granddaughter show
their guest his quarters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;Such as they are,&rdquo; she smiled, as she led
Hal to a rude hut next to their own. &ldquo;But
it&rsquo;s the best we have to offer&mdash;we reserve it
especially for infrequent guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She led Hal through a low, narrow opening
and nodded at the single chair, the hammock
and the washbasin on an old-fashioned stand.
It was primitive, but scrupulously neat and
clean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things have just gone along so-so with we
Pembertons,&rdquo; she explained apologetically.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to grow much more than potatoes
here. We raise chickens and a half
mile from here we can get all the pineapples
you want to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy!&rdquo; Hal exclaimed. &ldquo;That sounds darn
good to me&mdash;just like home. And chicken?
Young lady, I&rsquo;m your friend for life. You
don&rsquo;t happen to drink such luxurious beverages
as tea and coffee, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through Rene&rsquo;s generosity we allow ourselves
that luxury,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;This property
yields us no income whatsoever, Mr. Hal.
And it yields but half of our food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why on earth do you people stay
here?&rdquo; Hal asked, flinging himself down on
the chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather again,&rdquo; said the girl wistfully.
&ldquo;It was here that we found Father&rsquo;s
canoe and camping outfit, but no lode. And
Grandfather, bound as he is to memories and
to the dim, dead past, had us pack up and
leave our more comfortable quarters thirty
miles below here and come live on this poverty-stricken
site. He said that if Father had
died here, we should live here in his memory.
A queer man is my grandfather, Mr. Hal.
He&rsquo;s old and I respect him&mdash;indeed, I
wouldn&rsquo;t think of being aught but obedient to
his every wish. Still, I cannot help thinking
that his bitterness is not good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bitterness is terrible,&rdquo; Hal agreed. &ldquo;But
one thing, it hasn&rsquo;t affected you and that&rsquo;s
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen too much of it. It hasn&rsquo;t affected
my brother Rene, except in a political way.
Grandfather&rsquo;s ideas about free men in the
jungle has affected him, but that&rsquo;s all. He&rsquo;s
come to believe that the jungle man should
rebel and take part of the earnings of his more
fortunate brother in the cities.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;What a strange, struggling family you
are!&rdquo; Hal said, watching the girl&rsquo;s sad,
piquant face. &ldquo;Memories and the past are all
right as long as they don&rsquo;t interfere with the
happiness of the present, huh? I bet you
think that way, don&rsquo;t you, Miss Felice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, Mr. Hal,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re
the first one to whom I&rsquo;ve confessed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s safe with me,&rdquo; Hal said whimsically,
&ldquo;and what&rsquo;s more it&rsquo;s better on my
chest than on yours. I&rsquo;m glad I came along to
relieve you of the burden, honest I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m glad you came along too. Rene
stays away so long sometimes. It gets rather
dull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not when I&rsquo;m around,&rdquo; Hal chuckled, and
looked down at the girl intently. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
something about me, my uncle always says,
that seems to whoop things up wherever I go.
He says I&rsquo;m not in a place very long before
things just naturally begin to happen. So if
that holds good here too, Miss Felice, just sit
tight and hope for the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed heartily and, shaking her finger
playfully at Hal, stepped outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst can&rsquo;t be too bad for me,&rdquo; she
called back over her slim shoulder. &ldquo;The
worst would be better than just this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And by that same token did Felice Pemberton
invite the long arm of destiny into that
little settlement on the <i>River of Pale Death</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV
<br /><span class="small">AFTER DINNER</span></h2>
<p>Hal reveled in the luxury of a hammock
that long afternoon and slept the sleep of the
righteous. He awakened, feeling fresh and
stronger than any time since the plane wreck.
And to add to his delight, Mr. Pemberton&rsquo;s
favorite Indian, Joaquim, was standing patiently
at the door proffering shaving materials
and a change of clothes including a
worn but clean pair of khaki knickers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Se&ntilde;or Rene&rsquo;s,&rdquo; the Indian explained
as he held out the knickers. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or will
fit&mdash;no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;sure. Rene&rsquo;s not so much shorter
than I. And I bathe in the river, huh, Joaquim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Se&ntilde;or. But watch for the electric
fish. They send shock and sometimes people
die from it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve got enough electricity in me
without clashing with those fish, Joaquim.
Thanks for the tip, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so he bathed without incident, shaved
and dressed, then strolled toward the Pemberton
hut, a broad, low structure of mud and
thatch. Felice and her grandfather were on
hand to greet him.</p>
<p>The building boasted of three good-sized
rooms, that is, it was one vast room partitioned
off into three. Two of the partitions, Felice
explained, were used as bedrooms and the
third, a wide room across the front of the hut,
was their dining-living room.</p>
<p>That room, into which Hal was ushered,
boasted of a fair-sized dining table, a half-dozen
rickety chairs, an antique sideboard,
and a dilapidated couch. The kitchen, Felice
explained, was in Joaquim&rsquo;s hut and under his
own supervision.</p>
<p>They sat down to a nicely set table and Hal
perceived that Felice&rsquo;s slim brown hand had
given the extra touches in honor of a guest.
A worn but clean tablecloth gleamed under
the candlelight, and the silver, he was certain,
had graced the table of many generations of
Pembertons in Virginia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>Hal ate his fill of chicken, fish, sweet potatoes,
cooling pineapple, and two cups of
coffee. True, it was rather bitter and was
flavored with condensed milk, but coffee had
never been so welcome and he sat sipping the
second cup with some Brazilian cigarettes
which Old Marcellus kept for guests.</p>
<p>The old man was pleasant, and he beguiled
Hal with divers tales of his experiences in the
Amazon jungle. Now and then a note of bitterness
would creep into his feeble voice, but
upon looking at Hal&rsquo;s smiling countenance he
would dismiss his subject and begin on another.
But always he seemed to come back to
the same subject, that of his long missing son.</p>
<p>His days and nights, the whole of his remaining
life was spent thinking of that tragic
affair. Hal&rsquo;s heart went out to him and he
wondered what his life would have been&mdash;what
all their lives would have been if that terrible
thing hadn&rsquo;t happened!</p>
<p>Felice had sat quietly through her grandfather&rsquo;s
long recital. Finally she sat up
straight in her chair and shook her small,
golden head determinedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now Grandfather,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Mr. Hal
has been hearing our story ever since he came
up the river to <i>Manaos</i>. Suppose we let him
have an end to this Phantom of Death River
and change to a lighter vein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Felice,&rdquo; said Old Marcellus.
&ldquo;No doubt the young man is terribly bored. I
forget myself and talk, talk, talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, not at all,&rdquo; Hal assured them.
&ldquo;I lean toward things like this&mdash;I mean
toward the supernatural. Of course I don&rsquo;t
take any stock in it that Miss Felice&rsquo;s father
is roaming around and screaming in jaguar
form. I don&rsquo;t believe that at all, but the idea
fascinates me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re a romanticist, Mr.
Hal,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;If you weren&rsquo;t, you
wouldn&rsquo;t get into a scrape like that plane business.
It pays to beware of strangers, especially
men like Se&ntilde;or Goncalves. He must be
a very cold-blooded man to have devised such
a scheme. I&rsquo;ve told Grandfather how you
met him on your way to <i>Manaos</i> and the subsequent
events.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granting all that,&rdquo; said Old Marcellus, &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t understand why the Se&ntilde;or should want
to take your uncle&rsquo;s life and your own. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I wanted to ask, but didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
Felice said smiling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I forgot to tell you,&rdquo; Hal explained.
&ldquo;You are people of honor and I can entrust
to you the secret of my uncle&rsquo;s mission up
here. He&rsquo;s a secret service man and he
brought me along with him on the exciting
chase of a munition&rsquo;s smuggler. That is, he&rsquo;s
trying to help the Brazilian Government, in
co&ouml;peration with our own, to trace the smuggling
of munitions to this country. And if we
find the man who&rsquo;s the go-between on this end,
we&rsquo;ll soon learn who the manufacturers are in
the U. S.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is the man&mdash;<i>Renan</i>?&rdquo; asked Old
Marcellus softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo; Hal returned eagerly.</p>
<p>Before they could answer, Joaquim appeared
in the doorway, gesticulating to his
master and looking quite perturbed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI
<br /><span class="small">A FAMILIAR VOICE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Joaquim?&rdquo; asked the old man.</p>
<p>Joaquim&rsquo;s tongue loosed in rapid-fire
Portuguese for fully two minutes. Felice sat
tense, her hands clenching the tablecloth and
her face noticeably pale. And the old man,
though apparently quite calm, had two patches
of color that came and went at intervals in his
bony cheeks.</p>
<p>When the Indian had finished Old Marcellus
stood up, talked crisply in Portuguese,
then dismissed the servant. That done, he
turned to Hal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just some visitors, young man,&rdquo; he said
courteously. &ldquo;You will excuse me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Hal said smiling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
taking up your time too long anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt you feel fatigued still?&rdquo; Felice
asked in a strained manner.</p>
<p>Hal was not a little surprised but he managed
to conceal it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can always sleep, Miss Felice,&rdquo; he said
with a chuckle. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve grown up
to be such a big boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She giggled, but grew instantly serious as
he said goodnight. Old Marcellus bowed
gravely and showed almost too palpably that
he would feel immensely relieved when his
guest was gone to his hut.</p>
<p>Hal felt the situation as one of his temperament
feels everything&mdash;<i>intensely</i>. He knew
that there was some deep, underlying motive
for the strange behavior of his host and
hostess. Too, he knew that the sudden visitors
whom Joaquim announced must have given
them cause for deep concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then that&rsquo;s their business,&rdquo; Hal told
himself as he strolled toward the hut. &ldquo;Why
should it have anything to do with me? It&rsquo;s
been said that every family keeps a skeleton
or two hidden in the closet. Maybe this is the
night that the Pembertons are letting theirs
out for a walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal had quite forgotten the incident by the
time he got into his hammock and under the
net so solicitously provided by Joaquim. He
was sleepier than he realized and after smoking
another of Old Marcellus&rsquo; Brazilian
cigarettes, he closed his eyes willingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>He thought over all that had happened during
the day, particularly his meeting with
Felice. He liked saying her name aloud.
There was something soft and soothing in the
sound. He thought of her frailness and thin,
pinched cheeks and immediately he wanted to
do something for her that would make her look
bright and healthy, not sad and weary-looking
as he visualized her then.</p>
<p>He had a mind picture of her laughing
along some unfrequented trail in Ramapo,
whose picturesque hills took on its winter
cloak when the Amazon was at its highest temperature.
She would look pretty, he decided,
when the wind blew hardest and the snow flew
thickest. There wasn&rsquo;t the slightest doubt
about it&mdash;Felice belonged in Ramapo and he
determined to tell her so.</p>
<p>Suddenly his thoughts switched to the immediate
present. His uncle would soon hear
that he was safe, and so would his mother. At
last! His next move was to start back for
<i>Manaos</i>. But as he had been gone this long he
could defer it a few days, as long as no one was
worrying about him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>The Pembertons interested him too much to
leave right off. He chuckled. The Pembertons?
Why fool himself! It was Felice who
interested him and he knew that it was especially
so because of the glamour of mystery
surrounding her life in the wilderness.</p>
<p>In any event, he was inspired to do something
manly and adventurous for this frail
wilderness flower. And to sleep he went, with
this generous and noble desire making peaceful
his deep slumber.</p>
<p>That it was deep, Joaquim witnessed when
he crept stealthily under the doorway of the
hut of their honored guest. Soundlessly he
stole up to Hal&rsquo;s hammock and listened intently
for fully five minutes to his soft, even
breathing. Then, with a satisfied air, the Indian
stole out again.</p>
<p>Hal, however, being temperamental, was
often disturbed by another&rsquo;s mere presence.
It was so in this case, for he was awake and sitting
up in his hammock before Joaquim&rsquo;s
stealthy figure had cleared the doorway. And
though he was still dazed, he knew that the
Indian&rsquo;s presence was a sign that Old Marcellus
and his granddaughter were up to something.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>Hal got into his clothes in a minute and
crept cautiously toward the door. He stood
and listened there before he emerged and even
then put out his head and looked about carefully.</p>
<p>There was no sound except the low murmur
of voices from Pemberton&rsquo;s hut. He could not
distinguish them at all and proceeded to move
further out into the clearing when he suddenly
saw Joaquim&rsquo;s squat figure move out of
the shadows and down toward the river.</p>
<p>Hal moved noiselessly up to the Pemberton
hut and drew close into its protecting shadows.
Old Marcellus was talking in even tones, calm
and distinct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;this used to be a
<i>Pallida</i> settlement. Why do you ask, Se&ntilde;or?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curiosity, Se&ntilde;or Pemberton,&rdquo; said a soft,
purring voice. &ldquo;And your son, his canoe, his
camp was found here&mdash;no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But surely you heard the story many
times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so thoroughly as I heard it lately,
Se&ntilde;or. And the <i>Pallidas</i> they did not come
back to claim their settlement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Old Marcellus. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s their
custom not to reclaim a settlement once they&rsquo;re
driven off by a white man. They have a reputation
for superstition you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;But your son, he drove them off, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; he believed there was a lode somewhere
here worth a fortune. But poor man,
he gave his life for that illusion. My grandson
and I have hunted the length and breadth
of this clearing in vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but that is the way of life, eh, Se&ntilde;or?
Now we must be going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But did you come only to ask me about
my poor lost son? Have you no <i>message</i>?&rdquo;
Old Marcellus asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None, Se&ntilde;or. Perhaps when next I come.
<i>Adios!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal waited to hear no more and scooted
back to the shadow of his doorway. Soon he
saw the dark figures of men emerging from
Pemberton&rsquo;s hut and he heard the soft whisper
of voices. Old Marcellus he distinguished
by his white, silvery hair, but the rest he could
not make out. Besides, Joaquim&rsquo;s squat body
came wobbling up from the river and escorted
the two short visitors back to the bank.</p>
<p>Hal was puzzled, yet he could not help feeling
that there was something familiar looking
about the pair. Certainly, somewhere he had
heard the speaker&rsquo;s voice inside the hut. That
soft, slow purring....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII
<br /><span class="small">AND THEN....</span></h2>
<p>Hal went back to his hammock without
having come to any definite decision. After
all, it was difficult to distinguish one&rsquo;s voice
through layers of mud and thatch, especially
when one was talking at a low pitch.</p>
<p>The following day he had breakfast with
Felice. Her grandfather, she explained, lay
abed late because of his age. She seemed gay
and carefree as she spoke and it was hard for
Hal to believe that he had seen her so tense
and weary only the night before.</p>
<p>He rested some during the day, took a stroll
along the river bank with Felice, and fished
the rest of the day. Old Marcellus kept much
to himself and seemed rather taciturn when
spoken to. At dinner that evening, he did not
appear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather is worrying about my
brother, Rene,&rdquo; said Felice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>Hal looked across the table and smiled comfortingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, I guess he can take care of himself,
huh? I&rsquo;ll admit I was worried too, but since
I know he&rsquo;s your brother and have heard what
a &lsquo;rep&rsquo; he&rsquo;s got, I have the idea that he can
take care of himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he can take care of himself,&rdquo; Felice
said thoughtfully, &ldquo;but we aren&rsquo;t always
the master of a situation. Rene is sometimes
headstrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gol darn it,&rdquo; Hal said, noticing the sadness
in her gray eyes, &ldquo;I do believe you&rsquo;re worried
about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really am, Mr. Hal. You see he&rsquo;s never
kept us waiting so long. He&rsquo;s always so concerned
about Grandfather and me. Really
he&rsquo;s been all that&rsquo;s helped me to bear this
lonely existence. I couldn&rsquo;t bear anything to
happen to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my goodness, Miss Felice, I&rsquo;m certain
nothing has happened to him if he&rsquo;s such a
roamer as you&rsquo;ve told me! Please don&rsquo;t
worry! If there&rsquo;s anything I can do....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You liked him, didn&rsquo;t you, Mr. Hal?&rdquo; she
asked suddenly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say I did,&rdquo; Hal answered readily. &ldquo;I
thought he was one swell chap. Man, he&rsquo;s the
kind I like&mdash;you know, plain but not stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Felice seemed relieved. She smiled sweetly
and freely then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that a nice person like you
couldn&rsquo;t help liking Rene. You&rsquo;re so much
alike&mdash;loyal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Miss Felice. I&rsquo;ll always try to
live up to that reputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a promise?&rdquo; she asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cross my heart and hope to die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were gay after that and strolled about
the clearing in the moonlight before they said
goodnight. Hal walked on air to his little
hut and was so thoughtful that he climbed into
his hammock with his clothes on.</p>
<p>But it was just as well, for he hadn&rsquo;t any
desire to sleep and was up again in a few moments.
How could he sleep when a lovely girl
like Felice exacted a promise from him to be
loyal? He&rsquo;d be loyal to her whole family just
to see her smile!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>Suddenly it occurred to him that her request
for his loyalty was not only meaningless but
odd. What did she want him to be loyal to?
To whom? He felt silly when he thought that
he had made a promise when he didn&rsquo;t know
what it was all about. Still, he could stand
feeling silly where Felice was concerned.</p>
<p>He stamped out a half-smoked cigarette and
walked out into the clearing. It was a lovely
night, breathless and clear, with just enough
moon for shadow. Before he realized it, he
was down at the river, gazing dreamily at the
swiftly moving water.</p>
<p>Suddenly he heard the unmistakable sound
of a canoe paddling toward him. Instinctively,
he drew back under the tree, barely
escaped stepping on a peacefully sleeping
snake, and in trying to sidestep it, he slipped
and rolled down the bank into some thick
bushes. And there he stayed.</p>
<p>The canoe had already come into view and
the bent forms of the two paddlers were directing
its course toward the bank. Straight
to the settlement it glided, like some long,
graceful snake.</p>
<p>Hal held his breath as it pushed into the
bank. He dared not stir the bushes for so
much as a peek then. They were too close at
hand. But then he had no need to see, for
they started to speak and he could listen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>They talked in Portuguese, however, speaking
in soft tones. Both voices struck Hal immediately
as being familiar&mdash;the one especially
so. But still he dared not stir, for he
knew that they had not gotten out of the canoe.
Then after a moment of silence, the familiar
voice spoke in English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is gold here&mdash;I feel it,&rdquo; it whispered.
&ldquo;We must get these Pembertons away&mdash;no?
It would be ver&rsquo; easy. The <i>Pallidas</i>,
they perhaps kill Se&ntilde;or Pemberton, Junior.
Why not make it look as if they do it again,
eh? Why not, Pizella?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Si, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; came the answer. &ldquo;Why
not so?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<h2 id="c28">CHAPTER XXVIII
<br /><span class="small">HE WHO RISKS NOTHING</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Quem nao arrisca nao ganha</i>,&rdquo; said Se&ntilde;or
Goncalves, twisting at his moustache. He
chuckled softly. &ldquo;Tomorrow night, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Si, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said Pizella in a whisper.
&ldquo;<i>Quem nao arrisca nao ganha.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly the swish of paddles sounded and,
with a creaking noise, the canoe pushed out of
the clay and back into the stream. Hal held
his breath listening for them to reveal something
more but not a word did they speak until
they put a great deal of distance between
themselves and the settlement.</p>
<p>Hal crawled out of the bushes, wiped his
hands on his handkerchief and scrambled up
the bank. He made no effort to conceal himself
but walked with determined step past the
Pemberton hut. A flickering light showed
someone to still be up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you, Miss Felice?&rdquo; Hal asked anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Hal.&rdquo; Her small, slim body
framed the doorway. &ldquo;Why, I thought you
went to bed an hour ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you did too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I was restless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here. Your grandfather asleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. Say, I was wondering what
<i>quem nao arrisca nao ganha</i> means! Can you
tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He who risks nothing, gains nothing,&rdquo; she
answered promptly. &ldquo;Where did you hear
it, Mr. Hal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, from two Brazil-nuts.&rdquo; He laughed.
&ldquo;How near are we to the next settlement and
how many people live there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the questions! But to answer them&mdash;we
live just twenty miles away from the
next settlement and there&rsquo;s a tribe of about
fifty Betoya Indians living there. They&rsquo;re
better left alone though, if you&rsquo;re thinking of
trying to promote good will. Some Brazilian
rubber men mistreated them not so long ago
and they&rsquo;re anything but in a conciliatory
frame of mind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t add to their worry then,&rdquo;
Hal said, feeling rather depressed. &ldquo;How
long does it take to get to <i>Manaos</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two long days. It depends on the skill
of the paddler. Sometimes it takes longer, but
certainly it&rsquo;s not less than that. Are you
thinking of leaving us, Mr. Hal?&rdquo; she asked
wistfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope, not yet. In fact, I&rsquo;m not going until
you see or get some word from your
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re kind, Mr. Hal! Awfully kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not kind&mdash;<i>human</i>,&rdquo; Hal laughed. &ldquo;I have
a weakness for human beings too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad, for we need someone with that
kind of weakness. But you seem a little&mdash;well,
serious. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your brother, Miss Felice. I don&rsquo;t want
to seem snoopy, but I&rsquo;d like seriously to see
him and talk to him. That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t
want you to feel offended if I ask you what
idea you have of his whereabouts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, er&mdash;Mr. Hal,&rdquo; said Old Marcellus,
rising out of the doorway in a faded dressing
gown and an air of injury. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this rather
a late hour for you to be talking to my....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;It makes not the slightest difference whom
I talk to, Mr. Pemberton,&rdquo; Hal interposed
pleasantly. &ldquo;In fact, I think it would be better
for you to be here. You heard my question
about your grandson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I did,&rdquo; said the old man with
some show of dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you can answer it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose I refuse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be absurd. After all, I want
to know only to help you and Miss Felice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s happened&mdash;<i>something</i>!&rdquo; Felice
gave a little cry. &ldquo;What is it, Mr. Hal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t meant to tell you, but I suppose
it&rsquo;s the only way to do. After all, you know
this country and I don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s simply this&mdash;not
ten minutes ago while I was hidden in the
bushes down at the river I overheard a conversation
between that cat Goncalves and his boy
friend, Pizella. It seems he has in his mind
some plan to drive you people out of here. He
said he felt that there was gold and he was
going to get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never; not over my dead body!&rdquo; said Old
Marcellus stiffening to his full height. &ldquo;If
there&rsquo;s gold here, we&rsquo;ll get it, not Carlo Goncalves!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope to tell you,&rdquo; Hal agreed vehemently.
&ldquo;But to get to the bottom of this&mdash;what is it
all about? I don&rsquo;t mean to pry, but I want
to help you people. I won&rsquo;t stand by and see
that little Brazil-nut misuse you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a bad lot, Goncalves,&rdquo; said Old Marcellus
more to himself than to Hal. &ldquo;And
Pizella too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could have told you that weeks ago,&rdquo;
Hal said. &ldquo;But evidently Goncalves got
started when he heard your story from the
captain of the boat. He was one of the listeners.
He probably is one of those fools who
thinks that all he has to do is to pull up at
some river bank and he&rsquo;ll find gold. Gold
isn&rsquo;t found as easily as that. Anyway, Mr.
Pemberton, you people know him, huh? He&rsquo;s
on a friendly footing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know him, but not because we want
to,&rdquo; said the old man between tightly drawn
lips. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s lately happened&mdash;to come
here....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re holding back something, Mr.
Pemberton. And there&rsquo;s absolutely no need
to. Nothing you say shall be held against
you.&rdquo; He laughed gently. &ldquo;I mean it, even
if my uncle is on the government&rsquo;s side. I
know that in some mysterious way you people
are connected with the revolutionary movement
here. You wouldn&rsquo;t know Goncalves
from Adam if you weren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>Felice, who had been standing silent
throughout this recital, suddenly put her
hand on Hal&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right about us, Mr. Hal,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;We are sort of connected with Ceara&rsquo;s
side. That is....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ceara&rsquo;s a patriot and devoted to the
<i>Cause</i>,&rdquo; said the old man suddenly. &ldquo;Goncalves
is a sneak and is in the <i>Cause</i> for greed
rather than patriotic motives. I&rsquo;ve suspected
that right along. Also he wants power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We meant it when we said that we thought
he was inhuman for what he tried to do to
you,&rdquo; said Felice angrily. &ldquo;We told him so
too! But he would go to any ends to get the
rest of the munitions through. He wants to
start fighting. He&rsquo;s jealous of Ceara&mdash;he&rsquo;s
jealous of my....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your brother, huh?&rdquo; Hal interposed.
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that what you were going to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Felice and her grandfather nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why we let you know so
much,&rdquo; she said, trying to smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know why?&rdquo; Hal asked. &ldquo;Because
you know in your heart I&rsquo;d rather help than
anything else. Besides I promised I&rsquo;d be
loyal, didn&rsquo;t I? Well, I mean it. And I can
understand how people all alone like you are
can mix up with the <i>Cause</i> as you call it. You
have nothing else to do in this wilderness.
Also, I understand now how your brother
could get into it. It&rsquo;s a wonder he didn&rsquo;t get
into worse mischief than this with so much
time on his hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know then that Rene is....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Renan</i>,&rdquo; Hal interposed smiling. &ldquo;I
guessed it quite a few hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<h2 id="c29">CHAPTER XXIX
<br /><span class="small">A SNOOPING YANKEE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Renan Carmichael Pemberton, that is
his full name,&rdquo; said Old Marcellus proudly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always called him Rene for short.
But what are you going to do about him, Mr.
Hal? You are loyal to your government as
well as to us, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Hal with a smile at Felice,
&ldquo;that I can dope out a way to be loyal to both.
Just one thing I&rsquo;d like to find out though&mdash;was
he in on that plane plot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can vouch for him that he wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Felice
said stoutly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Rene ever
met that Jos&eacute; Rodriguez before in his life.
There are many in the <i>Cause</i>, you know. They
can&rsquo;t all be acquainted. It was just a coincidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m inclined to believe it. Well, what do
you say we all turn in? We may not get such
a good sleep tomorrow night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>They all agreed and Hal was about to go
when he thought of something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about guns, Mr. Pemberton?&rdquo; he
asked the old man. &ldquo;Have you anything like
that around here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man said he had. Enough to protect
themselves for a little while. And Goncalves,
he was certain, was acting upon his own
initiative. Ceara, he declared, would have no
part in such a scheme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; Hal said aloud when he got
into his hammock a moment later. &ldquo;It would
pain me to know that Ceara did anything like
that after all the puffs he&rsquo;s been given!&rdquo; He
chuckled, then looked grave the next minute.</p>
<p>He was thinking about Renan&mdash;<i>Rene</i>, and
did not know which name he preferred. He
did know, however, that he thought the Pembertons
a queer lot. Somehow their connection
with the <i>Cause</i> amused him, and he wondered
if they, too, could not see the humorous
side of it. Renan must certainly see it.
Laughter and smuggled munitions!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>Hal realized after a while, however, that
there was not so much to laugh at with Goncalves.
He presented a problem grave enough
to make one frown. Meanwhile the time was
fleeing and before they knew it, the Se&ntilde;or
would be paying them a visit.</p>
<p>His mind was so full of this worry that he
slept but little and got up at dawn. After
dressing he hurried down to the river bank to
think it over, and in his nervous deliberation
he pulled out of his pocket the handkerchief
which he had had with him the night before.</p>
<p>It felt gritty to the touch, and when he went
to put it up to his face a light-colored substance
fell from it to the ground. It interested
him greatly.</p>
<p>Hal examined it curiously, particularly the
few particles that clung to the handkerchief.
Then he bethought himself of how, the night
before, he had slid down the sloping embankment
and into the bushes to avoid the canoeists.
That was where he had wiped the wet
clay from his hands.</p>
<p>He shook his head uncertainly and slid down
the embankment again. There he delved
about, poking into the embankment and
eagerly scrutinizing every bit of clay that
came out in his hand. In several places he
did this until he espied his footsteps in the wet
earth. Almost covering them was some more
clay which he had loosened in his fall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>He searched through it carefully and finally
brought up a handful of the yellow dust which
he scooped up immediately. Then he scrambled
up the bank and across the clearing, almost
running into Old Marcellus as he came
out of his door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;G&rsquo;d mornin&rsquo;, young sir. You seem to have
been as restless as myself,&rdquo; said the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks that way all right,&rdquo; Hal said, hardly
able to contain himself. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a good
thing I was restless. I think, Mr. Pemberton,
that I&rsquo;ve discovered something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that, young man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold,&rdquo; Hal answered, smiling. &ldquo;A whole
handkerchief full!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Great Scott!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed the astonished
old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pemberton,&rdquo; Hal said whimsically,
opening the handkerchief for his delighted inspection,
&ldquo;that expression you just used&mdash;<i>Great
Scott!</i>&mdash;is uttered by Americans only.
Do you know that? What&rsquo;s more it&rsquo;s a purely
Yankee term and yet you use it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t stand for that insult, young
man,&rdquo; said Old Marcellus with a faint gleam
of mirth in his weak blue eyes, &ldquo;if it wasn&rsquo;t
that you&rsquo;ve discovered my gold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you admit that you&rsquo;ve given praise
to a Yankee by using his name?&rdquo; Hal teased.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve committed the unpardonable sin, Mr.
Pemberton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I have,&rdquo; said the old man, biting
back the smile that wanted to shine on his
thin, haggard face. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not denying
now that it took a snooping Yankee to find our
gold&mdash;the gold that will mean so much to my
grandchildren.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Hal laughed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be a
snooping Yankee than....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Than what?&rdquo; the old man promptly asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Than Se&ntilde;or Carlo Goncalves,&rdquo; Hal answered
with a chuckle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<h2 id="c30">CHAPTER XXX
<br /><span class="small">PALE DEATH</span></h2>
<p>It rained terrifically that night, lashing
this way and that through the clearing. Truly,
it was a night to deter the most venturesome,
but as Hal had high regard for Se&ntilde;or Goncalves
as a moving force, he did not keep to
his hut and hammock. Instead, with Joaquim&rsquo;s
invaluable aid and two Colt revolvers,
they kept vigil under a tree at the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard Se&ntilde;or Goncalves say he come
tonight, Se&ntilde;or Hal?&rdquo; Joaquim asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Hal answered. &ldquo;I think he
meant to do it last night, but he didn&rsquo;t have
the nerve. He said something about making
it look as if the Indians had done it&mdash;the <i>Pallidas</i>!
Do you think it was they who killed
Mr. Pemberton&rsquo;s son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joaquim shrugged his broad shoulders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pallidas</i> think evil spirits get out when
white man digs deep in the ground, Se&ntilde;or.
They would kill him for that maybe. <i>Pallidas</i>
hate Se&ntilde;or Pemberton for chasing them
from settlement. Maybe they kill&mdash;we do not
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you think about Se&ntilde;or Rene,
Joaquim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, like master, that maybe Se&ntilde;or
Rene is being punished for angry talk about
you falling in plane. I think Ceara he hold
him there a time so he will not talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you and Mr. Pemberton think Se&ntilde;or
Renan didn&rsquo;t like the treatment I got, huh?
Well, maybe it&rsquo;s so. At least I like to think
that that&rsquo;s the sort of a bird he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joaquim nodded as if to say that Renan
Pemberton was exactly that kind. Be that as
it may, thinking was often convincing to Hal
and he had no further qualms in that direction.
His present anxiety was on the river
and from time to time he wondered just what
Goncalves had in his mind.</p>
<p>He did not have very long to wonder, however,
for, just before midnight, Joaquim
prodded Hal gently in the ribs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canoe she come,&rdquo; he muttered between his
teeth. &ldquo;We keep back in dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say we will,&rdquo; Hal whispered in return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>The canoe swished through the water and
presently appeared just below the settlement.
There seemed to be no other boats with them,
and Hal and the Indian exchanged glances of
satisfaction. Goncalves, sitting smug and
content while Pizella slaved at the paddle,
seemed to sense nothing unusual.</p>
<p>Hal noticed immediately that Pizella was
carrying a bow, and arrows were lying at his
feet. When he pushed the boat into the embankment
and got out with his bare feet to
make it fast he reached for them. Goncalves
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pallidas</i>&mdash;si?&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Si,&rdquo; responded Pizella.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast, Goncalves!&rdquo; Hal roared in a
voice that sounded almost sepulchral, coming
as it did from under the rain-dripping trees.
&ldquo;<i>We&rsquo;ve</i> got you covered!&rdquo; He said <i>we&rsquo;ve</i> as
if it constituted a tremendous armed force.</p>
<p>Goncalves moved like lightning. Without
a word, he shoved the boat back into the stream
with the tremendous energy of his excitement.
For some reason he seemed to have completely
forgotten the wading half-caste who stumbled
and tripped through the water in his haste to
clamber back into the canoe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>Hal fired the gun then over the Brazilian&rsquo;s
head. But the fellow had taken up the paddle
and began to stroke vigorously off in the dark.
Pizella meanwhile had neither been able to
gain the canoe or even keep up with him. Also,
it was apparent that the water was too high
for him to wade any longer.</p>
<p>He called frantically to Goncalves, called to
him to wait, Joaquim said. But as Hal had
already aimed another bullet at the Brazilian&rsquo;s
sleek head, there was no apparent slowing up
of the canoe for anything or anybody. Consequently,
Pizella dove into the high water,
clothes and all.</p>
<p>Hal tried another shot but the darkness and
the swiftly moving canoe made a sure aim impossible.
He thought he heard Goncalves
scream after a fourth shot had been fired, but
as Pizella was screaming also, they could not
be certain. Be that as it may, the Brazilian
kept right on paddling and was soon out of
sight.</p>
<p>Pizella was in a dilemma, to be sure. He
could not hope to reach his master&rsquo;s canoe and
he was afraid to return toward shore, where
goodness knows what horrible fate awaited
him. Hal felt almost sorry for him in that
moment, for Goncalves&rsquo; desertion of the half-caste
at such a time and in such a place
seemed heartless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>But Pizella seemed to have chosen the lesser
of two evils and turning his back upon the
raging current began to swim toward shore.
Hal and Joaquim watched him, interested,
each thinking that the man was braver than
his master ever dared to be.</p>
<p>In the midst of these reflections, they heard
him suddenly shriek, a blood-curdling yelp.
He was by that time, too, near enough in to
stand on his feet, which he did. But even as
they watched him they saw him raise his arms
and sort of stiffen from head to foot. The
next second he had plunged headfirst back into
the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Electric fish, Se&ntilde;or&mdash;he bite Pizella!&rdquo; Joaquim
shouted.</p>
<p>Hal got to his feet ready to jump in after
the half-caste, but the Indian put out a detaining
arm and pointed to the dark waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Already he sink,&rdquo; said Joaquim. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or
no can find now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>Hal looked, feeling not a little dazed by the
episode and saw that it was true. The water
rushing along on its heedless course had carried
the half-caste completely out of sight.
There was not a sign of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joaquim say right&mdash;no?&rdquo; said the Indian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too right,&rdquo; Hal answered thoughtfully.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t seem to gather my wits together and
remember how it all happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is because the <i>Pallida Mors</i> she is
swift, Se&ntilde;or Hal. Like that she grabs and
then we look&mdash;<i>no more</i>! The Indian he say
she wants all the time death. So many drown
in her, Se&ntilde;or. She look like death&mdash;no? She
pale for rushing river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is pale,&rdquo; Hal agreed. Even in the
darkness her pallid yellowish waters gleamed
eerily. He shuddered and turned his broad
back upon the stream. &ldquo;This pale death business
is getting on my nerves, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<h2 id="c31">CHAPTER XXXI
<br /><span class="small">A DECISION</span></h2>
<p>After a long, solemn conference in the Pemberton
hut next morning, it was decided that
Goncalves had been effectually squelched by
the ruse which Hal had so cleverly executed.
None of them anticipated a return visit from
the Brazilian with such a purpose in mind.
Old Marcellus felt confident that they were
safe from like marauders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s time we heard from Rene,&rdquo; said
the old man. &ldquo;Besides, somebody ought to put
word in General Ceara&rsquo;s ear about Se&ntilde;or
Goncalves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about me going?&rdquo; Hal asked more in
fun than anything. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Ceara would
receive me as a representative of the Pemberton
family, wouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why he wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Felice
said, pursing her full red lips thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Grandfather couldn&rsquo;t stand the journey, even
if it is only a five-hour paddle, and Joaquim
couldn&rsquo;t satisfactorily interpret a message.
I&rsquo;m out of the question in a revolutionary
camp, so you are the only solution. Joaquim
can go with you, Mr. Hal. If you start now
you&rsquo;ll be back tonight before midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me,&rdquo; Hal said gaily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be tickled
pink to pike a revolutionary camp. Only
you&rsquo;re sure they won&rsquo;t nab me in, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Ceara&rsquo;s a very just man, Hal,&rdquo;
Old Marcellus assured him. &ldquo;I shall give you
a letter of introduction to him, telling him that
I can vouch for your secrecy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about Goncalves&mdash;he might be so sore
at me that he&rsquo;ll try and whoop up things a
bit, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Ceara&rsquo;s long been provoked with
him, Hal,&rdquo; said Felice, unconsciously using
the young man&rsquo;s Christian name too. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
give your complaints just consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you say, <i>Felice</i>,&rdquo; Hal countered, smiling.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m to tell him then what greedy eyes
the Brazil-nut has cast on your gold hills, huh?
And it goes without saying, that I&rsquo;ll tell him
word for word about last night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course&mdash;don&rsquo;t forget that important
part. General Ceara is too much of a patriot
not to see that Goncalves is not a man for the
<i>Cause</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you, Felice,&rdquo; Hal said whimsically.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;d be the cause of any <i>Cause</i>
busting up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They talked over the question of food to be
taken on the trip, and while Old Marcellus
was writing his letters, they summoned Joaquim
and made known to him what was required.
Then just before noon Felice came
down to the river and helped push them off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get nervous, Hal,&rdquo; she called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your letter to Ceara will explain everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even that it&rsquo;s not my fault that my uncle&rsquo;s
a secret service man, hunting for your
brother?&rdquo; Hal laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said, giggling merrily.
&ldquo;Your uncle&rsquo;s not going to hunt for Rene after
you get back to <i>Manaos</i>, is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I can see Rene first and Unk next.
Those two will compromise and I don&rsquo;t mean
maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed they will.&rdquo; She waved a dainty
handkerchief toward the departing canoe and
smiled sweetly. &ldquo;Be sure that Rene gets the
other letter, Hal! I do hope he&rsquo;s there all
right. He&rsquo;s got to know we&rsquo;ve struck gold at
last. And because of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t thank me, Lady Felice. It was a
mere accident. Really, Goncalves ought to get
the credit for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head, trying to look severe at
Hal&rsquo;s raillery, but in the end she smiled and
called a warning to the Indian to be careful
of the river. Then when the canoe glided
swiftly out of sight of the settlement, she
called, &ldquo;Adios, Hal! I&rsquo;ll see you tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adios, yourself, Felice!&rdquo; Hal called back.
&ldquo;And as for tonight, that remains to be seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl laughed in answer, and Hal listened
to its sad, sweet echo until the noise of the
rapids deafened him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<h2 id="c32">CHAPTER XXXII
<br /><span class="small">THE CORONEL GONCALVES</span></h2>
<p>They turned off the <i>Pallida Mors</i> and into
a narrower stream. Small cataracts sprayed
down over rocky cliffs, sending a continuous
foam over the surface of the water. On the
whole, it seemed to be not so rough, and they
glided along hour after hour under the beaming
sun until Hal began to tire.</p>
<p>Joaquim&rsquo;s knowledge of the region was uncanny
and Hal perceived, before very long,
that the Indian must have made many such
trips back and forth to Ceara&rsquo;s camp. Also,
he seemed to know just to the minute when
they would arrive at the lonely jungle spot.</p>
<p>It was middle afternoon when Hal helped
Joaquim push the canoe well up into the foliage
overhanging the river bank. Then they
clambered up, up and, with the Indian in the
lead, came to a narrow trail over which they
marched for a half hour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do we walk as far as we ride?&rdquo; Hal asked
wearily.</p>
<p>Joaquim shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon now,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Listen,
Se&ntilde;or!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man&rsquo;s voice cried out sharply and Joaquim
answered him quickly. Hal could see no
one, but presently a rather wretched-looking
young man in tattered khaki emerged from
between the trees. He glanced at the newcomers
suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He want know who come here,&rdquo; the Indian
interpreted. &ldquo;He want know what we have
to show we come. I say letter from Se&ntilde;or
Pemb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righto,&rdquo; Hal said briskly, and took out his
letters. The one addressed to General Ceara
he gave to the sentry and the other he returned
to his pocket.</p>
<p>The fellow looked at the address on the envelope,
turned it every which way, then
glanced at Hal suspiciously again. Finally he
spoke to the Indian, talking for an interminable
time. When he had finished Joaquim
passed on the news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The General Ceara he is not here, but the
sentry say come, it will be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right by me, Joaquim old boy. Where
is Ceara&mdash;out to lunch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian shrugged his shoulders and at a
gesture from the sentry they fell into a march.
Hal, for some reason, felt not so comfortable
about having the fellow tramping at his back
with a bayonet in position. But as Joaquim
seemed not to mind this military formality, he
made the best of it too.</p>
<p>After a five-minute tramp they came suddenly
out on a broad plain. Dotted about its
outskirts were hundreds of small thatched
huts. Men roamed about, shaggy and unkempt
in their wrinkled and tattered khaki.
Others lounged about on the ground before
their huts and stared curiously at the newcomers.</p>
<p>They passed at least a half-dozen sentries
before their guard commanded them to stop
before a hut, much larger and more sumptuous
looking than the rest. Hal decided that this
must be the headquarters of the famous
Ceara.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>At a gesture from the guard, they were surrounded
by reinforcements while he stepped
inside the hut, manifestly to announce their
arrival. Hours seemed to pass while they
waited and Hal exchanged several calamitous
glances with Joaquim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Felice is expecting us back before
midnight,&rdquo; he said to the Indian once. &ldquo;From
the looks of things, we can&rsquo;t be certain which
midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal had reached the stage when he was resting
first on one foot and then on the other, and
neither one resting at all. The sentry at that
juncture came out and once more addressed
the Indian who in turn addressed his tall
young charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We go in,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We see Coronel
Goncalves, not General Ceara. Ceara he not
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Hal asked.</p>
<p>But it was too late. The sentry and a rear
flank fairly carried them in with occasional
light proddings of their bayonets. A large,
low-ceilinged room loomed up before Hal&rsquo;s
bright blue eyes, as did the many broken-down
chairs circled around a rickety table.</p>
<p>Behind the table Goncalves was purring and
twisting his little moustache.</p>
<p>He smiled sardonically up to Hal&rsquo;s vast
height and straightening his dapper little self
in the chair placed his elbows upon the table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, such a pleasure, Se&ntilde;or Hal!&rdquo; he
purred softly. &ldquo;To whom do I owe it on this
my first audience as Coronel of the revolutionary
forces?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal sent down his most brilliant smile in
return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t owe it to me, Goncalves,&rdquo; he
said with an uproarious laugh. &ldquo;You owe it
to Mr. Pemberton. I came to save him and
his daughter the fatigue of a journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember you were kind, Se&ntilde;or Hal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind all the apple-sauce, fellow.
Joaquim and I are in a hurry. My letter is
for General Ceara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Por Deus!&rdquo; said Goncalves with a mournful
face. &ldquo;You are but too late, Se&ntilde;or Hal.
General Ceara has died with the fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal looked straight down into the little
man&rsquo;s snapping eyes, and they wavered before
his own steady gaze. Goncalves was lying, he
knew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe anything of the kind, Goncalves,&rdquo;
Hal said with startling frankness.
&ldquo;But, nevertheless, I can tell you what we
want. <i>Renan!</i> His grandfather and sister
are worried sick about him. Now don&rsquo;t lie
about that, fellow&mdash;you can&rsquo;t put anything
over on me like lies&mdash;I can read them in those
soul reflectors of yours. And, man, they don&rsquo;t
add to your charms any, believe me.&rdquo; He
laughed mockingly. &ldquo;Now do I hear where
Renan is or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall see him, Se&ntilde;or. <i>Si.</i> In a moment,
eh? Just I want to ask you how is the
fine old Se&ntilde;or Marcellus, eh? And the what-you-call
stuck up Felice&mdash;no? Ah, she hate
me. But the Coronel Goncalves does not care,
Se&ntilde;or Hal. I get back. Si. While you and
the Se&ntilde;or Renan are safe under guard, some
<i>Pallidas</i> shall steal down upon the Pemberton
granddaughter and her grandfather&mdash;no? I
shall make it so. Si. The <i>Pallidas</i> they hate
the Pemberton for taking their settlement
from them. They think the family have evil
spirits because the se&ntilde;orita&rsquo;s father dig a
mine, eh? They want ver&rsquo; much to rid their
tribe of evil spirits, these <i>Pallidas</i>, and to kill
the Pembertons they think will bring them
luck.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an idiot to even say such things,&rdquo;
Hal shouted. &ldquo;Your mind must be all cut up,
isn&rsquo;t it? Who ever gave you charge of a lot of
normal men anyway? An idiot bossing sane
men. Well, let me tell you, Goncalves&mdash;you
lay a finger on that girl or her grandfather
and your days are numbered. They&rsquo;re numbered
anyway, as a matter of fact. Unk must
be on your trail good and plenty by now ...
when you think you&rsquo;re fooling a Yank like
Unk, you&rsquo;ve got to go some!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Se&ntilde;or Hal. Such talk! But how will
you know what the Coronel Goncalves is doing
when you are no more, eh? You won&rsquo;t,
Se&ntilde;or!&rdquo; Suddenly the little man&rsquo;s face
twisted in a maniacal smile. &ldquo;I want that gold
at Pembertons&rsquo;, <i>si</i>? I shall get it and no one
shall be alive to know! <i>Cada qual por si e
Deus por todos!</i>&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Joaquim touched Hal&rsquo;s hand affectionately
as the guards pushed him past with their bayonets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He say &lsquo;each for himself and God for us
all,&rsquo; Se&ntilde;or. I thought you like to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, thanks, Joaquim,&rdquo; Hal muttered
breathlessly. &ldquo;Looks as if we&rsquo;re going to be
separated, huh. Well, over the river and so
long, old top!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Adios</i>, Se&ntilde;or Hal! <i>Adios!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever became of Joaquim, Hal never
knew. Suffice to say, he never again saw the
kind-hearted and faithful Indian.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<h2 id="c33">CHAPTER XXXIII
<br /><span class="small">RENAN!</span></h2>
<p>The guards marched Hal to a hut not far
from the river trail and with a push thrust
him into the gloomy interior. Suddenly he
felt a hand reach out and touch his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keen, as I live!&rdquo; cried a familiar voice.</p>
<p>Hal looked down, his eyes becoming accustomed
to the dimness, and saw the smiling face
of Rene Carmichael.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Renan Carmichael Pemberton!</i>&rdquo; he
laughed and proffering his hand gripped the
other&rsquo;s with a hearty pressure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hear you&rsquo;ve got the dope all firsthand,
eh, Keen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how!&rdquo; Hal laughed. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
know which I like better&mdash;Rene or Renan!
I&rsquo;ll change off to vary the monotony, huh?
Just the same I&rsquo;m darn glad to see you&mdash;boy,
how glad!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re well and safe, eh, chappie?
Heavens, but I was worried about you. I suppose
you thought that I didn&rsquo;t care what happened
to you, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never. I just didn&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renan pointed to two rickety stools. They
sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not knowing that it was a put-up job by
that skunk Goncalves, I came straight here to
get Ceara to help me. That&rsquo;s where I made
my mistake, for Goncalves was here and when
he heard me mention your name to the general,
all was off. He accused me of being an
informer to the Federals and all that sort of
thing. Ceara understood that I didn&rsquo;t know
Rodriguez from Adam and he thought it was
pretty rotten work for Goncalves to do, but he
couldn&rsquo;t say too much. He was afraid of Goncalves,
that&rsquo;s the long and short of it. That&rsquo;s
why he had to put me in here&mdash;he <i>had</i> to, or
that little trouble maker would have gone all
over this camp saying the <i>General</i> played me
for a favorite&mdash;which he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here you&rsquo;ve been ever since, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I&rsquo;ve been. But tell me about yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal told him briefly, yet missing no important
detail, and summed it up with his singular
interview with the Coronel Goncalves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;And here I am, Rene, too. By special permission
of Col. Calves Liver out there. You
can be certain there are rats in his garret. He
talked like a madman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Heavens, Keen! You don&rsquo;t think he
really intends to play the <i>Pallidas</i> onto my
sister and grandfather, do you? Not that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rene, I wouldn&rsquo;t tell you only that I think
he means to do just that. I tell you the bird
isn&rsquo;t right! He means to make short work of
us, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renan clenched his hands together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got friends in this outfit&mdash;all these
men trust me and like me. They liked Ceara,
too, but, like everyone else, they fear Goncalves
like poison. But maybe I can work
something, Keen. Don&rsquo;t get discouraged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not, only Calves Liver told me the glad
news that Ceara died of fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He lied,&rdquo; Renan muttered darkly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
had the poor man shot. He was jealous of
everybody. Now that he&rsquo;s got Ceara out of
the way, and myself&mdash;he can rule. <i>Maybe.</i>
We&rsquo;ll see, Keen&mdash;we&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what a mess for a couple of Americans
to get into, huh? Excuse me though,
Rene, I forgot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Keen! I rather like being taken
for an American. If I had to do it all over
again....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I went into this more because I liked
Ceara. It was fascinating and Grandfather
talked radically to me. I got to think we were
abused, but now I see differently&mdash;I have ever
since I met you on the field that day. I got to
realize that we Civil War refugees are nothing
but a lot of soreheads and anything but a
sporting lot. Our grandparents and great-grandparents
who are responsible for bringing
us down to this desolate corner of the
world weren&rsquo;t big enough to stay on in the
South and come up smiling like the rest. Oh,
how I see it! We&rsquo;ve been brought up on bitterness
and prejudice and our terrible poverty&rsquo;s
made us think even worse things about
this land of our adoption. But no more. If I
ever get out of here I&rsquo;m going to the Brazilian
Government and get down on my knees for
forgiveness. Goncalves has made me see what
a pack of fools we are. What does he care
about political freedom or a square deal for
the jungle plantation owner? Not a darn
thing. Goncalves is rooting for Goncalves!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rene, you&rsquo;re simply great! My uncle
would be tickled pink to hear that kind of talk.
I do believe you&rsquo;d be given a full pardon by
both governments if you&rsquo;d only tell who the
munitions manufacturers are from whom
Ceara got his stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t tell you from Adam, Keen.
That&rsquo;s the work Goncalves did. He used my
name, that&rsquo;s all. So I got the credit for it, eh?
No, what I did was to run up and down the
jungle for recruits, that&rsquo;s all. Now you&rsquo;ve
heard it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my story is that, if we get out of
here, the most sensible thing for you to do is
to get that mine working and see that your
kid sister lives in a country where she&rsquo;s going
to be healthy. I never saw anybody so sad&mdash;honest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it&mdash;I know it, Hal. And I will!
I&rsquo;ll see that I do! Tonight! We&rsquo;ll get out of
here somehow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And somehow they did!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<h2 id="c34">CHAPTER XXXIV
<br /><span class="small">A FEAR</span></h2>
<p>Hal was witness to a miracle that midnight.
It was one of those rare occasions when a vast
body of men are all inspired with one thought,
one motive at one time. And Renan, that
friend of all men, achieved it.</p>
<p>It began in the early evening with the sentry
guarding their hut. Renan whispered to
him what horrors the self-styled Coronel was
planning for the Pemberton family that evening
and what extreme measures would have
to be taken to prevent death and destruction.</p>
<p>Toward mid-evening, after Coronel Goncalves
left the camp with a picked guard, word
had gone around to every man. By midnight
they were all assembled to carry out a common
purpose, Hal and Renan in the lead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>A half hour later a line of dark canoes
glided silently and swiftly through the water.
Overhead, the stars gleamed and from the surrounding
jungle strange noises came and went.
Now and again the men muttered softly, but
on the whole there was a deep silence.</p>
<p>After an interminable time they reached
the <i>Pallida Mors</i> and Hal heard Renan sigh
with relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so long now,&rdquo; he said gravely. &ldquo;If
only....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope for the best, Rene,&rdquo; Hal said comfortingly.</p>
<p>But the best was not pleasant, for when
they sailed through the dawn and into the
settlement, there was naught but charred bits
of thatched huts to tell the tale. Overhead, the
sky was black with vultures.</p>
<p>Renan sickened at the sight, but Hal kept
up and searched every inch of the place. The
Indian servants had expired, each with a
fancy poisoned arrow in his heart. But of
Felice and her grandfather there was not a
sign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going up to pay the <i>Pallidas</i> a visit,
Rene,&rdquo; Hal said darkly. &ldquo;And unless they
cut short their ceremonies we ought to be on
time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;You may be right about it, Hal,&rdquo; Renan
said anxiously. &ldquo;I know they&rsquo;re hours sometimes
with those ceremonies for driving out
the evil spirits. Perhaps poor Felice and
Grandfather....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be the cause of future happiness,&rdquo;
Hal said, trying to be as cheerful as he could.
&ldquo;Sometimes things <i>do</i> happen for the best,
even when they look to be their worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These <i>Pallida</i> Indians are the worst of
their kind, Hal,&rdquo; Renan reminded him.
&ldquo;Their superstitions are limitless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. I&rsquo;ve given quite a lot of thought
to this so-called <i>Phantom of Death River</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The jaguar in whom my father&rsquo;s supposed
to have been reincarnated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Hal answered thoughtfully. &ldquo;They
were pretty tricky thinking that up. But do
you know what, Rene? I think that they
made it up to keep people from getting too
snoopy about that poor wretch in the hut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The demented native?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Native?&rdquo; Hal returned. &ldquo;Listen, Rene&mdash;I
heard that supposed native cry right near
me and it didn&rsquo;t sound any more native than
you do. That wretch had the cry of a white
man, not a native.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hal!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Believe it or not. They even tried to
make me believe those cries were from the
jaguar, but I know what I heard. It was a
white man&rsquo;s cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you say so before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I couldn&rsquo;t quite bring myself to
thinking that such a horrible thought could be
true. Besides, Felice assured me that it was
a native and consequently none of the white
man&rsquo;s concern. But somehow yesterday and
today&mdash;especially after I talked with Calves
Liver this afternoon, I figured it out. It&rsquo;s
been going on for ten years, hasn&rsquo;t it, Rene?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, as far as we know. That&rsquo;s about the
time we got wind of the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Rene, I hope it&rsquo;s just an hallucination,
but your father ... he&rsquo;s been gone ten
years....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Heavens, Hal! Why ... it
couldn&rsquo;t be ... yet ... it&rsquo;s just ten years!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<h2 id="c35">CHAPTER XXXV
<br /><span class="small">A PHANTOM OF HOPE</span></h2>
<p>The massacre of the <i>Pallidas</i> will come
down in history, for a massacre it was. Renan
and Hal leading the rebel volunteers were met
that morning with a rain of poisoned arrows
issuing from every conceivable bit of foliage
on the banks of the settlement. War cries
trembled in the air, shrieks of women and children.</p>
<p>Hal was stunned by it for a moment, but an
arrow skimming off his tanned arm brought
him to action. He leaped out of the canoe with
Renan, pulling back the trigger of his gun
with every step they took up the bank. Behind
them came the rebels, shouting as they
ran forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>It was the work of minutes, but Hal lived a
lifetime and he could see by Renan&rsquo;s haggard
face that he did also. And when the smoke
cleared away they ran for the deserted <i>maloka</i>,
deserted, save for Felice and her grandfather,
who had been tied to the pillars, preparatory
to making the supreme sacrifice for their
companionship with the evil spirits.</p>
<p>The white men had come none too soon, she
told them when she had regained her composure.
And in a few words she explained
how the <i>Pallidas</i> had descended upon her and
her grandfather and carried them off to their
settlement. Goncalves had been with them,
but what became of him she did not know.</p>
<p>Hal led the men on the next inspection, an
inspection which he instinctively feared the
results of. But Renan urged him on, asking
him to go first and see if their worst fears were
well-founded.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they were.</p>
<p>No sound greeted Hal as he walked ahead of
the men. Not even a whisper greeted him as
he stepped into the gloom of the hut. All was
still as the tomb and a tomb it was indeed!
For the withered remnants of a white man lay
silent in death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>Hal brought out with him a notebook,
yellowed with age and soiled. Every page of
it was written on, some of the writing rational
and legible, and other pages scribbled on in
moments of frenzy and despair. Taken as a
whole, it depicted a man tortured by constant
confinement and lost hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me, Hal?&rdquo; Renan asked as Hal handed
it to him. He took it, with white face and
trembling hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s addressed to you, Rene. Good
heavens, I&rsquo;d rather spare you....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renan bent his head and read with misty
eyes. Hal had glanced over the first few heartbreaking
pages when he picked it up in the
hut. He could even memorize a few of the
lines, so vividly had they stood out before his
eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;They captured me that morning,&rdquo; it read,
&ldquo;and I guess it was because they were superstitious
about the lode. Also because it was on
their former settlement.... They were getting
ready to offer me as a sacrifice to clear
out the evil spirits, when I happened to think
that they were superstitious about killing a
demented man.... I saved myself but condemned
myself to eternal death and suffering.
They locked me up and here I&rsquo;ve been except
for occasional nights when I managed to get
as far as the door and cry for help ... but no
one came, except for that red-headed young
man. They had bound and gagged me while
he was here. That is why he didn&rsquo;t understand
me when I cried ... hope went then
... my son Rene, my girl Felice, my father
... oh, that we had never come to this
wretched country.... I&rsquo;ve feigned madness
so long, I&rsquo;m going mad now.... I&rsquo;m
gone....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pathos of that last line dwelt in Hal&rsquo;s
memory. He knew he&rsquo;d never forget it. And
worse, he could never banish from his mind
the picture of despair and lost hope which
Marcellus Pemberton, Junior, bore even unto
death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<h2 id="c36">CHAPTER XXXVI
<br /><span class="small">ADIOS!</span></h2>
<p>Two weeks later, Hal was sitting with his
uncle, under the cooling shade of a palm tree.
It was early afternoon and most of <i>Manaos</i>
was under cover for the siesta period. A light
breeze blew and though it was a warm day
they felt not uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Hal had just come in on one of the up-river
boats that morning. He had shaved, gotten a
hair cut, and blossomed forth with his relative
in an immaculate suit of flannels. A pair of
sport shoes covered his sturdy feet and for the
first time in a month he felt clean and utterly
at peace with all the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This has been the first chance we&rsquo;ve had
to talk, Hal, do you realize that?&rdquo; Denis Keen
reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been too busy taking off my jungle
coat,&rdquo; Hal laughed. &ldquo;But what do you want
to know that I didn&rsquo;t write you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for one thing, I&rsquo;m interested to
know what that poor devil Pemberton died
of. You just wrote that he was dead when
you found him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s all I can tell you, Unk,&rdquo; Hal
said earnestly. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t find a mark or
scratch on him anywhere, so I guess a doctor
would say it was from natural causes. I&rsquo;d
call it a broken heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt, poor fellow. It&rsquo;s the saddest
thing I ever heard of. Still, those benighted
<i>Pallidas</i> didn&rsquo;t know any better. You say they
were almost wiped out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, we had to. They rained poisoned
arrows on us like as if it was snowing. Some
of the older warriors and the women and the
children escaped into the jungle. They won&rsquo;t
be seen for many a year, believe me. But
didn&rsquo;t those rebel boys work! Gosh, they were
aces high, Renan included.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad for their sakes. Your friend
Rene&rsquo;s, too. Today&rsquo;s paper said they were all
to be fully pardoned by the government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And by that same token your case is
knocked in the head, huh, Unk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. The <i>Cause</i> just simply isn&rsquo;t
any more. Thanks to Renan. He&rsquo;s quite a
hero to Brazil, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d be an asset to any country, Unk. The
U. S. will be proud to have him back. Felice,
also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean especially Felice, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw now, Unk, don&rsquo;t rub it in. Old Marcellus
isn&rsquo;t to be left out either. He&rsquo;s like a kid
going away to the country for the first time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denis Keen puffed leisurely on his cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have quite a full house on the boat
then, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say we will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And despite the tragedies, there&rsquo;ll be a lot
living happily ever after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell &rsquo;em, Unk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mists have cleared away and even the
worst of your experiences will be softened by
the time you get home. Time is something to
be thankful for, Hal. At least you have found
out everything you wanted to find out, eh?
All except Goncalves. It is a mystery where
he ever disappeared to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal shook back a lock of hair and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a mystery to me, Unk. I wouldn&rsquo;t be
the least surprised to find out that Se&ntilde;or Goncalves
turns out to be the Phantom of Death
River!&rdquo;</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
